This file containes the change log for the next major version of Spacemacs.

* Release 0.106.x
** 0.106.0 (no date)
*** IMPORTANT: Breaking changes
- Key binding ~SPC :~ acting as M-x as been replaced by ~SPC SPC~.
  If you want to revert to the old ~SPC :~ key binding set the new
  variable =dotspacemacs-emacs-command-key= to ":".
- Key bindings ~SPC j h~ and ~SPC j l~ have been moved to ~SPC j 0~ and
  ~SPC j $~ respectively.
*** Hot new features
- Support for Ivy, add the =spacemacs-ivy= layer to your dotfile and
  restart. Helm will be replaced by Ivy.
*** New Layers
- spacemacs-ivy in =completion= (thanks to justbur)
- spacemacs-helm in =completion= (moved from spacemacs-base) (thanks to justbur)
*** Dotfile changes
- The variable =dotspacemacs-command-key= has been renamed to
  =dotspacemacs-emacs-command-key= (the old name is still valid though).
- New variable =dotspacemacs-emacs-command-key= which is the key to
  press after the leader key to execute =M-x=.
- New variable =dotspacemacs-ex-substitute-global=, if non-nil then
  the behavior of the =g= flag in =:subsitute= ex-command is inverted.
  Default value is nil (thanks to fbergroth)
*** Distribution layer changes
- Command prefix ~SPC j~ is now also for =jumping=, introduced key bindings are:
  - ~SPC j 0~ to go to the beginning of line (and set a mark at the previous
    location in the line)
  - ~SPC j $~ to go to the end of line (and set a mark at the previous location
    in the line)
  - ~SPC j b~ to jump to a bookmark
  - ~SPC j c~ to jump to a character in the buffer (works as an evil motion)
  - ~SPC j d~ to jump to a listing of the current directory
  - ~SPC j D~ to jump to a listing of the current directory (other window)
  - ~SPC j f~ to jump to the definition of the function under the point
  - ~SPC j i~ to jump to a definition in buffer (imenu)
  - ~SPC j I~ to jump to a definition in any buffer (imenu)
  - ~SPC j k~ to jump to next line and indent it using auto-indent rules
  - ~SPC j l~ to jump to a line with avy (works as an evil motion)
  - ~SPC j u~ to undo a jump (go back to previous location)
  - ~SPC j U~ to jump to a URL in the current buffer
  - ~SPC j v~ to jump to the definition/declaration of the variable under the
    point
  - ~SPC j w~ to jump to a word in the current buffer (works as an evil motion)
  (thanks to justbur)
*** Layer changes
**** Ansible
- Change key binding ~SPC m a ?~ to ~SPC m h a~
**** Auto-completion
- New layer variable =auto-completion-complete-with-key-sequence-delay= to
  set the delay in second between the keys of sequence used to select
  the auto-completion candidate (thanks to MadAnd)
**** CSharp
- New key bindings
  - ~SPC m g c~ to go to member in current file
  - ~SPC m g I~ to find implementations using ido
  - ~SPC m g U~ to find usages of symbol under cursor using ido
  - ~SPC m r M~ to rename symbol under cursor interactively
  (thanks to retran)
**** Javascript
- New layer variable =javascript-disable-tern-port-files=, when non nil
  tern port files are not created. Default value is nil. (thanks to mijoharas)
**** mu4e
- Add =mu4e-maildirs-extension= package (thanks to choppsv1)
**** Python
- New key bindings to manage virtual environments:
  - ~SPC m V a~ to activate a virtual environment in any directory
  - ~SPC m V d~ to deactivate the active virtual environment
  - ~SPC m V w~ to work on virtual environment in ~WORKON_HOME~
  (thanks to cpaulik)
**** Rust layer
- Remove layer variable =rust-enable-racer=, now =racer= is always used
  (thanks to fbergroth)
- Remove package =company-racer= since =racer= works with default
  =company= backends (thanks to fbergroth)
**** Shell
- New =eshell-z= package (thanks to CestDiego)
*** Other fixes and improvements
- Typos and documentation improvements (thanks to cpaulik, TheBB)
