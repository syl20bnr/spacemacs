This file containes the change log for the next major version of Spacemacs.

* Release 0.106.x
** 0.106.0 (no date)
*** IMPORTANT: Breaking changes
- =hybrid-mode= implementation has been reworked and simplified, if you
  use =hybrid-mode= please check the [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/wiki/Hybrid-Editing-Style-Changes][wiki page]] to migrate your configuration.
- =extensions= are deprecated as announced in previous releases, if you still
  have =extensions= directories you must rename them to =local= and move
  the contents of the =extensions.el= files to the =packages.el= files adding
  the keyword =:location local= to them in the package list. Refer to other
  layers for examples (for instance the =python= layer)
- =<package>-excluded-packages= variables are now deprecated as announced is
  previous releases, you must now  use the keyword =:excluded t= of the package
  list, see the =vim-empty-lines= layer for example.
- Key binding ~SPC :~ acting as M-x as been replaced by ~SPC SPC~.
  If you want to revert to the old ~SPC :~ key binding set the new
  variable =dotspacemacs-emacs-command-key= to ":".
- Key binding ~SPC f e h~ is now ~SPC h SPC~
- Delete things key bindings are now more consistent using the ~d~ key, we
  had to move ~SPC w c~ and ~SPC w C~ to ~SPC w d~ and ~SPC w D~.
- ~SPC j~ prefix has been modified to include =jump= commands:
  - =avy= commands are now behind the prefix ~SPC j~ for =jump=:
    - ~SPC j j~ to jump to a character in the buffer (works as an evil motion)
    - ~SPC j l~ to jump to a line with avy (works as an evil motion)
    - ~SPC j w~ to jump to a word in the current buffer (works as an evil motion)
  - the following key bindings have been moved:
    - ~SPC j j~ to split a line has been moved to ~SPC j n~
    - ~SPC j h~ and ~SPC j l~ have been moved to ~SPC j 0~ and ~SPC j $~
      respectively.
    - ~SPC J~ to split a string or sexp has been moved to ~SPC j s~
- All helm related key bindings under ~SPC h~ that are not about help have
  moved to different key bindings:
  - ~SPC h b~ for =helm-filetered-bookmarks~is now ~SPC f b~
  - ~SPC h l~ for =helm-resume= is now ~SPC r l~
  - ~SPC h L~ for =helm-locate-library= is now ~SPC f e l~
- Spacemacs layouts scope has been changed, now ~SPC b b~ lists the buffers of
  the current layout, use ~SPC B b~ to list all the opened buffers.
- =org-indent= is now turned off by default
- Micro states are now called transient states
- Spacemacs layouts and workspaces transient states now exit when a layout or
  workspace is selected, use ~C-0~ ... ~C-9~ to switch to a layout and keep
  the transient state open.
*** Hot new features

- Support for Ivy, add the =spacemacs-ivy= layer to your dotfile and
  restart to replace =Helm= by =Ivy= (thanks to justbur and contributors)

  state (thanks to justbur)

- New variable =dotspacemacs-emacs-command-key= which is the key to
  press after the leader key to execute =M-x=.
- New variable =dotspacemacs-ex-substitute-global=, if non-nil then
  the behavior of the =g= flag in =:subsitute= ex-command is inverted.
  Default value is nil (thanks to fbergroth)
- New variable =dotspacemacs-smart-closing-parenthesis=. If non-nil pressing
  the closing parenthesis ~)~ key in insert mode passes over any automatically
  added closing parenthesis, bracket, quote, etc...
  This can be temporary disabled by pressing ~C-q~ before ~)~
