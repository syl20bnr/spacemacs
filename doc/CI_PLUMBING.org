* Description
This file explains how our continuous integration operates and what problems
it solves. =It is works in progress.=

* Overview
** TLDR
Spacemacs is big - the active maintainers team is small. The more we can
automate - the better. We useÂ  [[https://circleci.com/][CircleCI]], [[https://github.com/features/actions][GitHub Actions]] and [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] to test PRs,
update/fixi documentation and exporting it to [[https://develop.spacemacs.org/]].

Most of the code is just a bunch of bash/ELisp scripts and yml files, but
some of the documentation tools are written in Clojure.
Check out [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/develop/.circleci][CircleCI]] and [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/develop/.github/workflows][GitHub Actions]] directories, the code is pretty much
self-explanatory but will be examined in depth below.

** Current stack:
Wait, what? Why Clojure, why 2 CI providers?
I knew you would ask this question, dear reader, so here we go:

*** CircleCI
It has a cool set of features and a generous quota for open source projects.
But most importantly, unlike GitHub Actions, there is a straight forward way
to cache build dependencies between runs and using it in tandem with
GH Actions provides us with even more concurrency. It means that PR authors
have to wait less time for feed back. This is crucial since we have a lot of
test and platforms to cover. Also, CircleCI can run jobs on user provided Docker
images that it caches, so we do not hit the DockerHub pull quota.
On the downside, the CircleCI configuration file can be pretty involved,
has unexpected limitations that can leave you puzzled for quite a while.

*** GitHub Actions
Oh man, that's good. It is clear that GH team had the benefit of hindsight
when developed their CI platform. And it runs rely fast (at least for now).
Maybe one day we'll fully switch to Actions. The biggest concern here is
the vendor lock-in since all the good stuff is highly specific. While CircleCI
allows you to run a job locally for free. And run whole CI on your own
hardware with "strings attached".

*** Docker
Having a stable pre-build environment for jobs reduces headaches and
improves set up time. Duh!
Also DockerHub used to be a cool place to store and build huge images for
free, but now it has all sorts of quotas + RAM is pretty limited for memory
hungry JVM builds (((foreshadowing))).

*** Clojure
Besides the obvious fact that Rich Hickey's talks are the best.
Before we started with automation, Spacemacs already had a huge set of
documentation files that couldn't be fixed by a bunch of regular expressions
wrapped into bash/ELisp code.
The options were to either fix all README.org files by hand and keep fixing
them forever, since contributors often forget to format stuff properly and
nagging them constantly both wastes PR reviewer time and makes the
contributor less likely to stick. Or go all-in and create a system that
can extract data out of documentation files and rebuild them from scratch.
Clojure designed to push data around and it has specs that can be used
to validate files, generate test data and constructors for org-mode
elements. The code is compiled to [[https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/][native-image]] so pretty much all of
the JVM drawbacks are mitigated, for the particular use case anyway.
