* Core Pillars
Four core pillars: Mnemonic, Discoverable, Consistent and "Crowd-Configured".

If any of these core pillars is violated open an issue and we'll try our best
to fix it.

** Mnemonic
Key bindings are organized using mnemonic prefixes like ~b~ for buffer, ~p~ for
project, ~s~ for search, ~h~ for help, etc...

** Discoverable
Innovative real-time display of available key bindings. Simple query
system to quickly find available layers, packages, and more.

** Consistent
Similar functionalities have the same key binding everywhere thanks to a
clearly defined set of conventions. Documentation is mandatory for any layer
that ships with Spacemacs.

** Crowd-Configured
Community-driven configuration provides curated packages tuned by power users
and bugs are fixed quickly.

* Highlighted features
- *Bring the efficiency of modal editing* to the powerful Emacs lisp platform.
  Modal UX is optional and Spacemacs can be used with only Emacs key bindings.

- Integrate nicely with =Evil= states (=Vim= modes).

- *Keep your fingers on the home row* for quicker editing with support for
  QWERTY and BEPO layouts.

- *Minimalistic and nice graphical UI* keeps your available screen space for
  what matters: your text files.

- *Fast boot time*: packages and configuration are lazy-loaded as much as
  possible.

- *Lower the risk of RSI* by heavily using the space bar instead of modifiers.
  If you have issues with your thumbs you can still use Spacemacs using
  modifiers.

- Contribute easily your improvements and new configuration layers.

- *Very active and helpful community* on =Gitter= and =IRC=
  (via Gitter IRC bridge)

* Screenshots

[[file:img/spacemacs-python.png]]
/Python/

*Note*: Even though screenshots are updated frequently, Spacemacs is evolving
quickly and the screenshots may not reflect exactly the current state of the
project.

* Who can benefit from this?
- Spacemacs was initially intended to be used by *Vim users* who want to go to
  the next level by using Emacs (see [[file:VIMUSERS.org][guide]] for Vimmers). But it is now
  perfectly *usable by non Vim users* by choosing the =emacs= editing style.

- It is also a good fit for people wanting to *lower the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury][risk of RSI]]* induced by
  the default Emacs key bindings. (This is an assumption, there are no official
  studies to prove this!) If you have issues using your thumbs you can still
  use the =emacs= editing style which puts the leader key on a modifier
  combination.

- Emacs users wanting to learn *a different way to edit files* or wanting to
  learn Vim key bindings or even wanting to mix both editing styles by setting
  their style to =hybrid=.

- Emacs users wanting a simple but deep configuration system that greatly
  *lower the risk of .emacs bankruptcy*.

- *Pair-programming* users thanks to out of the box support for dynamic
  switching of editing style. A Vim user and an Emacs user can use the same
  Spacemacs comfortably.

* Update and Rollback
** Update Spacemacs repository
There are several methods of updating the core files and layer information for
Spacemacs. It is recommended to update the packages first; see the next section.

*** Automatic Updates
Spacemacs will automatically check for a new version periodically. When it
detects that a new version is available an arrow will appear in the modeline.
Click it to update Spacemacs. You must restart Emacs after updating.
[[file:img/powerline-update.png]]
/Update Button/

*Note*: If you use the =develop= branch of Spacemacs, automatic update is
disabled---you have to update manually using git.

*** Updating from the Spacemacs Buffer
Use the button labeled "Update Spacemacs" in the Spacemacs buffer. You will be
prompted for the version you would like to use.

*Note*: If you use the =develop= branch of Spacemacs, you cannot use this method.

*** Updating Manually with git
To update manually close Emacs and update the git repository:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ git pull origin master
#+END_SRC

*Note*: The master branch is considered to be immutable in the sense that you
must not modify it by adding your own commit. If you do so you will break the
automatic update of Spacemacs on the master branch. To fork Spacemacs code you
have to use a custom branch that you manage manually.

** Update packages
To update the Emacs packages used by Spacemacs press RET (enter) or click on the
link =[Update Packages]= in the startup page under the banner then restart
Emacs. If you prefer, you can use the command
=configuration-layer/update-packages= instead of the button.

If anything goes wrong you should be able to rollback the update by pressing
~RET~ or clicking on the =[Rollback Package Update]= link in the startup page
and choosing a rollback slot (sorted by date). This button uses the command
=configuration-layer/rollback=.

* Configuration layers
This section is an overview of layers. A more extensive introduction to writing
configuration layers can be found [[file:LAYERS.org][here]] (recommended reading!).

** Purpose
Layers help collect related packages together to provide features. For example,
the =python= layer provides auto-completion, syntax checking, and REPL support
for python files. This approach helps keep configuration organized and reduces
overhead for the user by keeping them from having to think about what packages
to install. To install all the =python= features the user has just to add the
=python= layer to their dotfile.

** Structure
Configuration is organized in layers. Each layer has the following structure:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    [layer_name]
      |__ [local]
      | |__ [package 1]
      | |     ...
      | |__ [package n]
      |-- layers.el
      |__ packages.el
      |__ funcs.el
      |__ config.el
      |__ keybindings.el

    [] = directory
#+END_EXAMPLE

Where:

| File           | Usage                                                                                            |
|----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| layers.el      | The place to declare additional layers                                                           |
| packages.el    | The list of packages and their configuration functions (init, post-init, etc...)                 |
| funcs.el       | All functions defined in the layer (used in package configuration for instance)                  |
| config.el      | Layer configuration (defines the layer variables default values and setup some config variables) |
| keybindings.el | General key bindings not tied to a specific package configuration                                |

=Packages= can be:
- =ELPA= packages installed from an =ELPA= compliant repository
- local packages in a layer's =local= folder
- installed from an online source using [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa][quelpa]].

** Configure packages
*** With a layer
**** Declaration
=Packages= are declared in a variable called =<layer>-packages= where =<layer>=
is the name of the layer.

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq <layer>-packages '(package1 package2 ...)
#+END_SRC

All packages from all layers are processed in alphabetical order so sometimes
you'll have to use some =with-eval-after-load= black magic to configure them
properly. For instance if package =A= depends on =B= then you can configure
=A= with:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'B ...)
#+END_SRC

For details on installing packages using quelpa or local packages see [[file:LAYERS.org::packages.el][LAYERS]].

**** Initialization
To initialize a package =xxx=, define a function with this format in
=packages.el=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun <layer>/init-xxx () ...body )
#+END_SRC

It is common to define the body with the [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] macro.

**** Exclusion
It is possible to exclude some packages from Spacemacs on a per-layer basis.
This is useful when a configuration layer aims to replace a stock package
declared in the Spacemacs layer.

To do so add the package names to exclude to the variable
=<layer>-excluded-packages=.

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq <layer>-excluded-packages '(package1 package2 ...)
#+END_SRC

*** Without a layer
Sometimes a layer can be an unnecessary overhead, this is the case if you just
want to install a package with very few configuration associated to it. A good
example is some niche language where you are only interested in syntax
highlighting.

You can install such packages by adding them to the variable
=dotspacemacs-additional-packages= under the =dotspacemacs/layers= function in your dotfile.

For example, to install =llvm-mode= and =dts-mode=:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/layers ()
  "Configuration Layers declaration..."
  (setq-default
   ;; ...
   dotspacemacs-additional-packages '(llvm-mode dts-mode)
   ;; ...
   ))
#+END_SRC

If you want to add some configuration for them then put the configuration in
the =dotspacemacs/user-config= function or consider creating a layer.

** Packages synchronization
Spacemacs will only install the packages that are explicitly used by the user.
A package is considered to be used if its layer is used (i.e. listed in
=dotspacemacs-configuration-layers=).
Any packages that are not used is considered to be orphan and is deleted at
the next startup of Emacs.

** Types of configuration layers
There are two types of configuration layers:
  - distributed layers (in the =layers= directory, those layers are contributions shared
    by the community and merged upstream)
  - private (in the =private= directory, they are ignored by Git)

** Submitting a configuration layer upstream
If you decide to provide a configuration layer, please check the contribution
guidelines first in [[file:../CONTRIBUTING.org][CONTRIBUTING]].

** Example: Themes Megapack example
This is a simple configuration layer listing a bunch of themes which you can
find [[file:../layers/%2Bthemes/themes-megapack/README.org][here]].

To install it, just add =themes-megapack= to your =~/.spacemacs= like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(themes-megapack))
#+END_SRC

Adding this layer will install around 100 themes; to uninstall them remove the
layer from the =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= and press ~SPC f e R~.

** Managing private configuration layers
Spacemacs's configuration system is flexible enough to let you manage your
private layers in different ways.

*** Using the private directory
Everything in the private directory is ignored by Git so it is a good place to
store private layers. There is a huge drawback to this approach though: /your
layers are not source controlled/.

*** Using an external Git repository
This is the recommended way to manage your private layers.

The best approach is to store all your private layers into an external Git
repository. It is especially a good practice to store them in your =dotfiles=
repository if you have one. Put also your =~/.spacemacs= file in it.

Then you are free to symlink your layers into =~/emacs.d/private= /or/ let them
anywhere you want and reference the parent directory in the variable
=dotspacemacs-configuration-layer-path= of your =~/.spacemacs=.

Note that you could also have a dedicated repository for all your private layers
and then directly clone this repository in =~/.emacs.d/private=.

*** Using a personal branch
The final main way to manage your private layers is to push them in a personal
branch that you keep up to date with upstream =master= or =develop=.

** Tips for writing layers
Please refer to [[file:LAYERS.org][this]] introduction for some tips on writing layers, and how to
best make them fit with the Spacemacs philosophy and loading strategy.

* Dotfile Configuration
User configuration can be stored in your =~/.spacemacs= file.

** Dotfile Installation
The very first time Spacemacs starts up, it will ask you several questions
and then install the =.spacemacs= in your =HOME= directory.

** Alternative dotdirectory
A dotdirectory =~/.spacemacs.d/= can be used instead of a dotfile.
If you want to use this option, move =~/.spacemacs= to =~/.spacemacs.d/init.el=.

It is also possible to override the location of =~/.spacemacs.d/= using the
environment variable =SPACEMACSDIR=. Of course you can also use symlinks to
change the location of this directory.

*Note:* =~/.spacemacs= will always take priority over =~/.spacemacs.d/init.el=,
so =~/.spacemacs= must not exist for =~/.spacemacs.d/init.el= to be used by
Spacemacs.

** Synchronization of dotfile changes
To apply the modifications made in =~/.spacemacs= press ~SPC f e R~. It will
re-execute the Spacemacs initialization process.

*Note*: A synchronization re-executes the functions =dotspacemacs/init=,
=dotspacemacs/user-init= and =dotspacemacs/user-config=.
Depending on the content of this functions you may encounter some unwanted side
effects. For instance if you use a toggle in =dotspacemac/user-config= to enable
some behavior, this behavior will be turned off whenever the dotfile is
re-synchronized. To avoid these side-effects it is recommended to either use
=setq= expressions instead of toggle functions, or to use the =on= or =off=
versions instead (i.e. instead of =spacemacs/toggle-<thing>=, use
=spacemacs/toggle-<thing>-on= or =spacemacs/toggle-<thing>-off=).

It is possible to /skip/ the execution of =dotspacemacs/user-config= with the
universal argument (~SPC u SPC f e R~).

** Testing the dotfile
You can use the command =SPC SPC dotspacemacs/test-dotfile= to check if your
=~/.spacemacs= looks correct. This will check, among other things, whether the
declared layers can be found and that the variables have sensible values. These
tests are also run automatically when you synchronize with ~SPC f e R~.

** Dotfile Contents
*** Configuration functions
Three special functions in the =~/.spacemacs= file can be used to perform
configuration at the beginning and end of Spacemacs loading process:

- =dotspacemacs/layers= is called at the very startup of Spacemacs initialization,
  this is where you set the Spacemacs distribution and declare layers to be used
  in your configuration. You can also add or exclude packages of your choice
  and tweak some behavior of Spacemacs loading.
- =dotspacemacs/init= is called at the very startup of Spacemacs initialization
  before layers configuration. *You should not put any user code* in there
  besides modifying the Spacemacs variable values prefixed with =dotspacemacs-=.
- =dotspacemacs/user-init= is called immediately after =dotspacemacs/init=,
  before layer configuration. This function is mostly useful for variables
  that need to be set before packages are loaded.
- =dotspacemacs/user-config= is called at the very end of Spacemacs
  initialization after layers configuration. This is the place where most of
  your configurations should be done. Unless it is explicitly specified that a
  variable should be set before a package is loaded, you should place your code
  here.
- =dotspacemacs/emacs-custom-settings= is a generated function where all Emacs
  custom settings are written. You should not edit this function. See
  =Custom variables= section for more information.

*** Custom variables
By default custom variables from =M-x customize-group= are automatically saved
at the end of your =~/.spacemacs= file in the function
=dotspacemacs/emacs-custom-settings= unless you declare a custom =custom-file=
in the =dotspacemacs/user-init= function, in this case custom variables will be
written to the user defined =custom-file= and the function
=dotspacemacs/emacs-custom-settings= will remain empty.

*Note:* If you set a custom =custom-file= value then it is your responsibility
to load this file at the appropriate time. Often the best time to load it is
just after setting the value for =custom-file= in the =dotspacemacs/user-init=
function.

** Declaring Configuration layers
To use a configuration layer, declare it in your dotfile by adding it to the
=dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= variable of your =~/.spacemacs=.

*Note:* In this documentation a =used layer= is equivalent to a =declared
layer=.

For instance, [[Thank you][RMS]] can add his private configuration layer like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
                '(
                  ;; other layers
                  ;; rms layer added at the end of the list
                  rms
                  ))
#+END_SRC

Official layers shipped with Spacemacs are stored in =~/.emacs.d/layers=. The
directory =~/.emacs.d/private= is a drop-in location for your private layers.
It is possible to put layers at the location of your choice provided you tell
Spacemacs where to look for them. This is done by setting the list
=dotspacemacs-configuration-layer-path= in your =~/.spacemacs=. For instance
to add some layers in =~/.myconfig=, set the variable like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layer-path '("~/.myconfig/"))
#+END_SRC

*** Setting configuration layers variables
Some configuration layers have configuration variables to enable specific
feature. For instance the [[file:../layers/+source-control/git/README.org][git layer]] has several configuration variables, they
can be set directly in the =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/layers ()
  ;; List of configuration layers to load.
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    '(auto-completion
      (git :variables
           git-magit-status-fullscreen t
           git-variable-example nil)
      smex)))
#+END_SRC

The =:variables= keyword is a convenience to keep layer configuration close to
their declaration. Setting layer variables in the =dotspacemacs/user-init=
function of your dotfile is also a perfectly valid way to configure a layer.

*** Disabling layer services in other layers
Often layers enable services that other layers can use. For instance if you use
the layer =auto-completion= then every other layers supporting =auto-completion=
will have this feature enabled.

Sometimes you may want to disable a service added by a layer in some specific
layers. Say you want to disable =auto-completion= in =org= and =git= layers,
you can do it with the following layer declaration.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/layers ()
  ;; List of configuration layers to load.
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    '(org git
      (auto-completion :disabled-for org git))))
#+END_SRC

You can also use the =:enabled-for= construct to disable it for /all/ layers
/except/ those explicitly identified.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/layers ()
  ;; List of configuration layers to load.
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    '(java python c-c++
      (auto-completion :enabled-for java python))))
#+END_SRC

Note that =:enabled-for= may be an empty list.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/layers ()
  ;; List of configuration layers to load.
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    '(java python c-c++
      (auto-completion :enabled-for))))
#+END_SRC

=:enabled-for= takes precedence over =:disabled-for= if both are present.

*** Selecting/Ignoring packages of a layer
By default a declared layer installs/configures all its associated packages. You
may want to select only some of them or ignoring some of them. This is possible
with the =:packages= keyword.

For instance to ignore the =neotree= and =fancy-battery= packages from
=spacemacs-ui-visual= layer:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/layers ()
  ;; List of configuration layers to load.
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    '(auto-completion
      (spacemacs-ui-visual :packages (not neotree fancy-battery))))
#+END_SRC

The opposite would be to ignore all packages except =neotree= and
=fancy-battery=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/layers ()
  ;; List of configuration layers to load.
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    '(auto-completion
      (spacemacs-ui-visual :packages neotree fancy-battery)))
#+END_SRC

*Note:* Ignoring a package from a layer is different than excluding a package.
An excluded packages is completely removed from your configuration whereas an
ignored package is ignored only for a given layer but it can remain on your
system. It happens that if the given layer is the owner of the package then
ignoring this package is the same as excluding it (because the package becomes
orphan so it is considered unused by Spacemacs).

*** Excluding packages
You can exclude packages you don't want to install with the variable
=dotspacemacs-excluded-packages= (see [[#configuration-layers][Configuration layers]] for more info
on packages).

For instance, to disable the =rainbow-delimiters= package:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-excluded-packages '(rainbow-delimiters))
#+END_SRC

When you exclude a package, Spacemacs will automatically delete it for you the
next time you launch Emacs or at the next dotfile synchronization. All the
orphan dependencies are also deleted automatically. Excluding a package
effectively remove _all_ references to it in Spacemacs without breaking the rest
of the configuration, this is a powerful feature which allows you to quickly
remove any feature from Spacemacs.

*Note:* A few packages are essential for Spacemacs to correctly operate, those
packages are protected and cannot be excluded or uninstalled even if they become
orphans or are excluded. =use-package= is an example of a protected package that
cannot be removed from Spacemacs.

* Concepts
** Editing Styles
Spacemacs comes with several editing styles which can be switched dynamically
providing an easier way to do pair programming, for instance between a Vim user
and an Emacs user.

Three styles are available:
- Vim,
- Emacs,
- Hybrid (a mix between Vim and Emacs).

*** Vim
Spacemacs behaves like in Vim using [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][Evil]] mode package to emulate Vim key bindings.
This is the default style of Spacemacs; it can be set explicitly by setting
the =dotspacemacs-editing-style= variable to =vim= in the dotfile.

To bind keys in Vim editing style (=insert state=):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-key evil-insert-state-map (kbd "C-]") 'forward-char)
#+END_SRC

*** Emacs
Spacemacs behaves like in raw Emacs using the Holy mode which configures Evil to
make the =emacs state= the default state everywhere.
Set the =dotspacemacs-editing-style= variable to =emacs= in the dotfile.

In Emacs style the leader is available on ~M-m~. It is possible to toggle it on
and off with ~SPC t E e~ and ~M-m t E e~. When off the =vim= style is enabled.

To bind keys in Emacs editing style (=emacs state=):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-key evil-emacs-state-map (kbd "C-]") 'forward-char)
#+END_SRC

*** Hybrid
The hybrid editing style is like the Vim style except that =insert state= is
replaced by a new state called =hybrid state=. In =hybrid state= all the Emacs
key bindings are available; this is like replacing the =insert state= with the
=emacs state= but provides an isolated key map =evil-hybrid-state-map=.

To bind keys in Hybrid editing style (=hybrid state=):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-key evil-hybrid-state-map (kbd "C-]") 'forward-char)
#+END_SRC

This style can be tweaked to be more like Emacs or more like Vim depending
on the user preferences. The following variables are available to change the
style configuration:

- =hybrid-mode-default-state= The default state when opening a new buffer,
  default is =normal=. Set it to =emacs= for a more emacsy style.
- =hybrid-mode-enable-hjkl-bindings= If non-nil then packages will configure
  =h j k l= key bindings for navigation.
- =hybrid-mode-enable-evilified-state= If non-nil buffer are =evilified= when
  supported, if nil then =emacs= state is enabled in those buffers instead.
- =hybrid-mode-use-evil-search-module= If non-nil then use evil own search
  module which is closer to Vim search behavior.

Default configuration is:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-editing-style '(hybrid :variables
                                                  hybrid-mode-enable-evilified-state t
                                                  hybrid-mode-enable-hjkl-bindings nil
                                                  hybrid-mode-use-evil-search-module nil
                                                  hybrid-mode-default-state 'normal)
#+END_SRC

To toggle the hybrid style on and off use ~SPC t E h~ and ~M-m t E h~. When
off the =vim= style is enabled.

** States
Spacemacs has 10 states:

| State        | Default Color | Description                                                                                                |
|--------------+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| normal       | orange        | like the =normal mode of Vim=, used to execute and combine commands                                        |
| insert       | green         | like the =insert mode of Vim=, used to actually insert text                                                |
| visual       | gray          | like the =visual mode of Vim=, used to make text selection                                                 |
| motion       | purple        | exclusive to =Evil=, used to navigate read only buffers                                                    |
| emacs        | blue          | exclusive to =Evil=, using this state is like using a regular Emacs without Vim                            |
| replace      | chocolate     | like =replace mode of Vim=, overwrites the character under point instead of inserting a new one            |
| hybrid       | blue          | exclusive to Spacemacs, this is like the insert state except that all the emacs key bindings are available |
| evilified    | light brown   | exclusive to Spacemacs, this is an =emacs state= modified to bring Vim navigation, selection and search.   |
| lisp         | pink          | exclusive to Spacemacs, used to navigate Lisp code and modify it (more [[#editing-lisp-code][info]])                               |
| iedit        | red           | exclusive to Spacemacs, used to navigate between multiple regions of text using =iedit= (more [[#replacing-text-with-iedit][info]])        |
| iedit-insert | red           | exclusive to Spacemacs, used to replace multiple regions of text using =iedit= (more [[#replacing-text-with-iedit][info]])                 |

Note: Technically speaking there is also the =operator= evil state.

** Evilified modes
Some buffers are not for editing text and provide their own keybindings for
certain operations. These often conflict with Vim bindings. To make such buffers
behave more like Vim in a consistent manner, they use a special state called
/evilified/ state. In evilified state, a handful of keys work as in Evil, namely
=/=, =:=, =h=, =j=, =k=, =l=, =n=, =N=, =v=, =V=, =gg=, =G=, =C-f=, =C-b=,
=C-d=, =C-e=, =C-u=, =C-y= and =C-z=. All other keys work as intended by the
underlying mode.

Shadowed keys are moved according to the pattern: =a= → =A= → =C-a= → =C-A=

For example, if the mode binds a function to =n=, that is found under =C-n= in
evilified state, since both =n= and =N= are reserved, but =C-n= is not. On the
other hand, anything originally bound to =k= will be found on =K=, since =k= is
reserved but =K= is not. If there is a binding on =K=, that will be moved to
=C-k=.

In addition to this, =C-g=, being an important escape key in Emacs, is skipped.
So anything bound to =g= originally will be found on =C-G=, since =g=, =G= and
=C-g= are all reserved.

** Evil leader
Spacemacs uses a leader key to bind almost all its key bindings.

This leader key is commonly set to ~​,​~ by Vim users, in Spacemacs the leader
key is set on ~SPC~ (the space bar, hence the name =spacemacs=). This key is the
most accessible key on a keyboard and it is pressed with the thumb which is a
good choice to lower the risk of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury][RSI]]. It can be customized to any other key
using the variable =dotspacemacs-leader-key= and =dotspacemacs-emacs-leader-key=.

With Spacemacs there is no need to remap your keyboard modifiers to attempt
to reduce the risk of RSI, every command can be executed very easily while you
are in =normal= mode by pressing the ~SPC~ leader key, here are a few examples:

-  Save a buffer: ~SPC f s~
-  Save all opened buffers: ~SPC f S~
-  Open (switch) to a buffer: ~SPC b b~

** Universal argument
The universal argument ~C-u~ is an important command in Emacs but it is also a
very handy Vim key binding to scroll up.

Spacemacs binds ~C-u~ to =scroll-up= and changes the universal argument binding
to ~SPC u~.

** Transient-states
Spacemacs defines a wide variety of =transient states= (temporary overlay maps)
where it makes sense. This prevents one from doing repetitive and tedious
presses on the ~SPC~ key.

When a =transient state= is active, a documentation is displayed in the
minibuffer. Additional information may as well be displayed in the minibuffer.

Auto-highlight-symbol transient state:
[[file:img/spacemacs-ahs-transient-state.png]]
[[#text][Text scale transient state]]:

[[file:img/spacemacs-scale-transient-state.png]]

* Differences between Vim, Evil and Spacemacs
- The ~​,​~ key does "repeat last ~f~, ~t~, ~F~, or ~T~ command in
  opposite direction in =Vim=, but in Spacemacs it is the major mode specific
  leader key by default (which can be set on another key binding in the
  dotfile).

Send a PR to add the differences you found in this section.

** The vim-surround case
There is one obvious visible difference though. It is not between =Evil= and
=Vim= but between Spacemacs and [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround][vim-surround]]: in visual mode the =surround= command is on ~S~
in =vim-surround= whereas it is on ~s~ in Spacemacs.

This is something that can surprise some Vim users so here are some motivations
behind this change:
  - ~s~ and ~c~ do the same thing in =visual state=,
  - ~s~ is only useful to delete /one/ character and add more than one character
    which is a /very/ narrow use case
  - ~c~ accept motions and can do everything ~s~ can do in =normal state=
    (note that this is also true for ~r~ but ~r~ is more useful because it
    stays in =normal state=)
  - =surround= command is just a more powerful command than ~s~.

If you are not convinced, then here is the snippet to revert back to the default
=Vim + vim-surround= setup (add it to your =dotspacemacs/user-config= function or
your =~/.spacemacs=):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(evil-define-key 'visual evil-surround-mode-map "s" 'evil-substitute)
(evil-define-key 'visual evil-surround-mode-map "S" 'evil-surround-region)
#+END_SRC

* Evil plugins
Spacemacs ships with the following evil plugins:

| Mode                          | Description                                |
|-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------|
| [[https://github.com/wcsmith/evil-args][evil-args]]                     | motions and text objects for arguments     |
| [[https://github.com/Dewdrops/evil-exchange][evil-exchange]]                 | port of [[https://github.com/tommcdo/vim-exchange][vim-exchange]]                       |
| [[https://github.com/cofi/evil-indent-textobject][evil-indent-textobject]]        | add text object based on indentation level |
| [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/evil-matchit][evil-matchit]]                  | port of [[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39][matchit.vim]]                        |
| [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/evil-nerd-commenter][evil-nerd-commenter]]           | port of [[https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter][nerdcommenter]]                      |
| [[https://github.com/cofi/evil-numbers][evil-numbers]]                  | like ~C-a~ and ~C-x~ in vim                |
| [[https://github.com/juanjux/evil-search-highlight-persist][evil-search-highlight-persist]] | emulation of hlsearch behavior             |
| [[https://github.com/timcharper/evil-surround][evil-surround]]                 | port of [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround][vim-surround]]                       |
| [[https://github.com/bling/evil-visualstar][evil-visualstar]]               | search for current selection with ~*~      |
| [[https://github.com/jaypei/emacs-neotree][NeoTree]]                       | mimic [[https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree][NERD Tree]]                            |

* Binding keys
Key sequences are bound to commands in Emacs in various keymaps. The most basic
map is the =global-map=. Setting a key binding in the =global-map= is achieved
with the function =global-set-key=. Example to bind a key to the command
=forward-char=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-]") 'forward-char)
#+END_SRC

The =kbd= macro accepts a string describing a key sequence. The =global-map= is
often shadowed by other maps. For example, =evil-mode= defines keymaps that
target states (or modes in vim terminology). Here is an example that creates the
same binding as above but only in =insert state= (=define-key= is a built-in
function. =Evil-mode= has its own functions for defining keys).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-key evil-insert-state-map (kbd "C-]") 'forward-char)
#+END_SRC

Perhaps most importantly for Spacemacs is the use of the bind-map package to
bind keys behind a leader key.
This is where most of the Spacemacs bindings live. Binding keys behind the
leader key is achieved with the functions =spacemacs/set-leader-keys= and
=spacemacs/set-leader-keys-for-major-mode=, example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(spacemacs/set-leader-keys "C-]" 'forward-char)
(spacemacs/set-leader-keys-for-major-mode 'emacs-lisp-mode "C-]" 'forward-char)
#+END_SRC

These functions use a macro like =kbd= to translate the key sequences for you.
The second function, =spacemacs/set-leader-keys-for-major-mode=, binds the key
only in the specified mode. The second key binding is active only when the
major mode is =emacs-lisp=.

Finally, one should be aware of prefix keys. Essentially, all keymaps can be
nested. Nested keymaps are used extensively in spacemacs, and in vanilla Emacs
for that matter. For example, ~SPC a~ points to key bindings for "applications",
like ~SPC a c~ for =calc-dispatch=. Nesting bindings is easy.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(spacemacs/declare-prefix "]" "bracket-prefix")
(spacemacs/set-leader-keys "]]" 'double-bracket-command)
#+END_SRC

The first line declares ~SPC ]~ to be a prefix and the second binds the key
sequence ~SPC ]]~ to the corresponding command. The first line is actually
unnecessary to create the prefix, but it will give your new prefix a name that
key-discovery tools can use (e.g., which-key).

There is much more to say about bindings keys, but these are the basics. Keys
can be bound in your =~/.spacemacs= file or in individual layers.

* GUI Elements
Spacemacs has a minimalistic and distraction free graphical UI:
  - custom [[https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline][powerline]] mode-line [[Flycheck integration][with color feedback]] according to current [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][Flycheck]] status
  - Unicode symbols for minor mode lighters which appear in the mode-line
  - [[Errors handling][custom fringe bitmaps]] and error feedbacks for [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][Flycheck]]

** Color themes
*** Default theme
The official Spacemacs theme is [[https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme][spacemacs-dark]] and it is the default theme
installed when you first started Spacemacs. There are two variants of the
theme, a dark one and a light one. Some aspects of these themes can be customized
in the function =dotspacemacs/user-init= of your =~/.spacemacs=:
  - the comment background with the boolean =spacemacs-theme-comment-bg=
  - the height of org section titles with =spacemacs-theme-org-height=

*** Choosing themes
It is possible to define your default themes in your =~/.spacemacs= with the
variable =dotspacemacs-themes=. For instance, to specify =spacemacs-light=,
=leuven= and =zenburn=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-themes '(spacemacs-light leuven zenburn))
#+END_SRC

=dotspacemacs-themes= entries accept the same properties as packages listed
in layers package lists or in =dotspacemacs-additional-packages=. So it is
possible to fetch a package from a specific location. For example, you could
fetch =zenburn= theme directly from the GitHub repository with the following
declaration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-themes
                '(spacemacs-light
                  leuven
                  (zenburn :location (recipe :fetcher github
                                             :repo "bbatsov/zenburn-emacs"))
                  ))
#+END_SRC

*Important note:* If you use =:location local= then you have to put your theme
in the directory =private/local/<theme-package-name>/= with =theme-package-name=
being the name of your package suffixed with =-theme= as mentioned in the Emacs
conventions.
 For instance if your theme is =foo= then you have to put our theme
files in the directory =private/local/foo-theme=.

You can cycle between the themes declared in =dotspacemacs-themes= with
~SPC T n~ and select an installed theme with ~SPC T s~.

| Key Binding | Description                                           |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC T n~   | switch to next theme listed in =dotspacemacs-themes=. |
| ~SPC T s~   | select a theme.                                       |

*** Browsing themes
You can see samples of all themes included in the =themes-megapack= layer
in this [[http://themegallery.robdor.com][theme gallery]] from [[https://twitter.com/robmerrell][Rob Merrell]].

*** Notes
- You don't need to explicitly list in a layer the theme packages you are
  defining in =dotspacemacs-themes=, Spacemacs is smart enough to remove those
  packages from the list of orphans.
- Due to the inner working of themes in Emacs, switching theme during the same
  session may have some weird side effects. Although these side effects should
  be pretty rare.
- In the terminal version of Emacs, color themes will not render correctly as
  colors are rendered by the terminal and not by emacs. You will probably have
  to change your terminal color palette. More explanations can be found on
  [[https://github.com/sellout/emacs-color-theme-solarized#important-note-for-terminal-users][emacs-color-theme-solarized webpage]].

** Font
The default font used by Spacemacs is [[https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro][Source Code Pro]] by Adobe. It is
recommended to install it on your system if you wish to use it.

To change the default font set the variable =dotspacemacs-default-font= in your
=.spacemacs= file. By default its value is:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-default-font '("Source Code Pro"
                                          :size 13
                                          :weight normal
                                          :width normal
                                          :powerline-scale 1.1))
#+END_SRC

If the specified font is not found, the fallback one will be used (depends on
your system). Also note that changing this value has no effect if you are
running Emacs in terminal.

The properties should be pretty straightforward, it is possible to set any valid
property of a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Low_002dLevel-Font.html][font-spec]]:
  - =:family= Font family or fontset (a string).
  - =:width= Relative character width. This should be one of the symbols:
    - ultra-condensed
    - extra-condensed
    - condensed
    - semi-condensed
    - normal
    - semi-expanded
    - expanded
    - extra-expanded
    - ultra-expanded
  - =:height= The height of the font. In the simplest case, this is an integer
    in units of 1/10 point.
  - =:weight= Font weight- one of the symbols (from densest to faintest):
    - ultra-bold
    - extra-bold
    - bold
    - semi-bold
    - normal
    - semi-light
    - light
    - extra-light
    - ultra-light
  - =:slant= Font slant- one of the symbols:
    - italic
    - oblique
    - normal
    - reverse-italic
    - reverse-oblique
  - =:size= The font size- either a non-negative integer that specifies the
    pixel size, or a floating-point number that specifies the point size.
  - =:adstyle= Additional typographic style information for the font, such as
    'sans'. The value should be a string or a symbol.
  - =:registry= The charset registry and encoding of the font, such as
    'iso8859-1'. The value should be a string or a symbol.
  - =:script= The script that the font must support (a symbol).

The special property =:powerline-scale= is Spacemacs specific and it is for
quick tweaking of the mode-line height in order to avoid crappy rendering of the
separators like on the following screenshot (default value is 1.1).

** GUI Toggles
Some graphical UI indicators can be toggled on and off (toggles start with ~t~
and ~T~):

| ~SPC T T~   | toggle frame transparency and enter transparency transient state |

*Note*: These toggles are all available via the =spacemacs-help= interfaces
(press ~SPC h SPC~ to display the =spacemacs-help= buffer).

**** Global line numbers
Line numbers can be toggled on in all =prog-mode= and =text-mode= buffers by
setting the =dotspacemacs-line-numbers= variable in your =~/.spacemacs= to =t=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-line-numbers t)
#+END_SRC

If it is set to =relative=, line numbers are show in a relative way:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-line-numbers 'relative)
#+END_SRC

=dotspacemacs-line-numbers= can also be set to a property list for finer control
over line numbers activation.

Available properties:

| Property              | Description                                                                                  |
|-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =:disabled-for-modes= | list of major modes where line numbering is inhibited                                        |
| =:enabled-for-modes=  | disable for all major modes except those listed. Takes precedence over =:disabled-for-modes= |
| =:relative=           | if non-nil, line numbers are relative to the position of the cursor                          |
| =:size-limit-kb=      | size limit in kilobytes after which line numbers are not activated                           |

Examples:

Disable line numbers in dired-mode, doc-view-mode, markdown-mode, org-mode,
pdf-view-mode, text-mode as well as buffers over 1Mb:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-lines-numbers '(:relative nil
                                           :disabled-for-modes dired-mode
                                                               doc-view-mode
                                                               markdown-mode
                                                               org-mode
                                                               pdf-view-mode
                                                               text-mode
                                           :size-limit-kb 1000))
#+END_SRC

Relative line numbers only in c-mode and c++ mode with a size limit of =dotspacemacs-large-file-size=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-lines-numbers '(:relative t
                                           :enabled-for-modes c-mode
                                                              c++-mode
                                           :size-limit-kb (* dotspacemacs-large-file-size 1000))
#+END_SRC

Enable line numbers everywhere, except for buffers over 1Mb:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-lines-numbers '(:relative nil
                                             :size-limit-kb 1000))
#+END_SRC

Enable line numbers only in programming modes, except for c-mode and c++ mode:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-lines-numbers '(:relative nil
                                             :enabled-for-modes prog-mode
                                             :disabled-for-modes c-mode c++-mode
                                             :size-limit-kb (* dotspacemacs-large-file-size 1000))
#+END_SRC

** Mode-line
The mode line is a heavily customized [[https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline][powerline]] with the following capabilities:
  - show the window number
  - color code for current state
  - show the number of search occurrences via anzu
  - toggle flycheck info
  - toggle battery info
  - toggle minor mode lighters

Reminder of the color codes for the states:

| Evil State         | Color     |
|--------------------+-----------|
| Normal             | Orange    |
| Insert             | Green     |
| Visual             | Grey      |
| Emacs              | Blue      |
| Motion             | Purple    |
| Replace            | Chocolate |
| Lisp               | Pink      |
| Iedit/Iedit-Insert | Red       |

Some elements can be dynamically toggled:

| Key Binding | Description                                                     |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC t m b~ | toggle the battery status                                       |
| ~SPC t m c~ | toggle the =org= task clock (available in =org= layer)          |
| ~SPC t m m~ | toggle the minor mode lighters                                  |
| ~SPC t m M~ | toggle the major mode                                           |
| ~SPC t m n~ | toggle the cat! (if =colors= layer is declared in your dotfile) |
| ~SPC t m p~ | toggle the point character position                             |
| ~SPC t m s~ | toggle system monitor (displayed in the minibuffer)             |
| ~SPC t m t~ | toggle the time                                                 |
| ~SPC t m T~ | toggle the mode line itself                                     |
| ~SPC t m v~ | toggle the version control info                                 |
| ~SPC t m V~ | toggle the new version lighter                                  |

**** Powerline font installation for terminal-mode users
Users who run Emacs in terminal mode may need to install the [[https://github.com/powerline/fonts][Powerline patched
fonts]] and configure their terminal clients to use them to make the Powerline
separators render correctly.

**** Flycheck integration
When [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][Flycheck]] minor mode is enabled, a new element appears showing the number of
errors, warnings and info.

[[file:img/powerline-wave.png]]
/Flycheck integration in mode-line/

**** Anzu integration
[[https://github.com/syohex/emacs-anzu][Anzu]] shows the number of occurrence when performing a search. Spacemacs
integrates nicely the Anzu status by displaying it temporarily when ~n~ or ~N~
are being pressed. See the =5/6= segment on the screenshot below.

[[file:img/powerline-anzu.png]]
/Anzu integration in mode-line/

**** Battery status integration
[[https://github.com/lunaryorn/fancy-battery.el][fancy-battery]] displays the percentage of total charge of the battery as well as
the time remaining to charge or discharge completely the battery.

A color code is used for the battery status:

| Battery State | Color  |
|---------------+--------|
| Charging      | Green  |
| Discharging   | Orange |
| Critical      | Red    |

Note the these colors may vary depending on your theme.

**** Powerline separators
It is possible to easily customize the =powerline separator= by setting the
=powerline-default-separator= variable in your =~./spacemacs= and then
recompiling the modeline. For instance if you want to set back the separator to
the well-known =arrow= separator add the following snippet to your configuration
file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
  "This is were you can ultimately override default Spacemacs configuration.
This function is called at the very end of Spacemacs initialization."
  (setq powerline-default-separator 'arrow))
#+END_SRC

To save you the time to try all the possible separators provided by the
powerline, here is an exhaustive set of screenshots:

| Separator    | Screenshot                        |
|--------------+-----------------------------------|
| =alternate=  | [[file:img/powerline-alternate.png]]  |
| =arrow=      | [[file:img/powerline-arrow.png]]      |
| =arrow-fade= | [[file:img/powerline-arrow-fade.png]] |
| =bar=        | [[file:img/powerline-bar.png]]        |
| =box=        | [[file:img/powerline-box.png]]        |
| =brace=      | [[file:img/powerline-brace.png]]      |

| =roundstub=  | [[file:img/powerline-roundstub.png]]  |
| =slant=      | [[file:img/powerline-slant.png]]      |
| =wave=       | [[file:img/powerline-wave.png]]       |
| =zigzag=     | [[file:img/powerline-zigzag.png]]     |
| =nil=        | [[file:img/powerline-nil.png]]        |

**** Minor Modes
Spacemacs uses [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiminishedModes][diminish]] mode to reduce the size of minor mode indicators:

The minor mode area can be toggled on and off with ~SPC t m m~

Unicode symbols are displayed by default. Setting the variable
=dotspacemacs-mode-line-unicode-symbols= to =nil= in your =~/.spacemacs= will
display ASCII characters instead (may be useful in terminal if you cannot set an
appropriate font).

The letters displayed in the mode-line correspond to the key bindings used to
toggle them.

Some toggle have two flavors: local and global. The global version of the toggle
can be reached using the =control= key.

| Key Binding | Unicode | ASCII | Mode                                                                 |

**** Customizing the mode-line
***** Spaceline
Spacemacs uses [[https://github.com/TheBB/spaceline][Spaceline]] to provide its mode-line. It consists of a number of
/segments/ arranged on the left and right sides. These are defined in the
variables =spaceline-left= and =spaceline-right=. Segments can be defined using
=spaceline-define-segment=, and added to the appropriate location in the left or
right hand side variables.

Please see the Spaceline documentation for more information.

***** Restore lighters
Lighters are abbreviations displayed in the mode-line to identify running minor
modes. Spacemacs diminishes most of them to make them more compact.

If you want to restore the original lighter of a mode then use the function
=spacemacs/diminish-undo= with the appropriate mode name.

For example to undo diminish for =company=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(spacemacs|use-package-add-hook company
    :post-config (spacemacs/diminish-undo 'company-mode))
#+END_SRC

Note that we use a =use-package= post init hook to be sure to override any
lazily diminished lighters (see [[file:LAYERS.org][layers documentation]] for more information
about lazy loading).

** Frame title
Default frame title displays name of current process and hostname of system. You
can include more information (like name of current file, name of current project
etc) by setting =dotspacemacs-frame-title-format= variable.

Following format short codes are avialable:

| Code | Description                                                                  |
|------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =%a= | the `abbreviated-file-name', or `buffer-name'                                |
| =%t= | `projectile-project-name'                                                    |
| =%I= | `invocation-name'                                                            |

*** Iconified (tabified) title
If you are using tiling window manager with tab support you may want to display
different title for inactive tabs with =dotspacemacs-icon-title-format=
variable. Short codes are same as for frame title.

If this variable is set to =nil= (default) its value will be same as
=dotspacemacs-frame-title-format=.

* Layouts and workspaces
Layouts are window configurations with buffer isolation, each layout can define
several workspaces (think of them as sub-layouts) sharing the same list of
buffers as their parent layout.

** Layouts
A layout is a window configuration associated with a list of buffers. The list
of buffers can be an arbitrarily chosen set of buffers. Spacemacs provides
some facilities to create meaningful sets of buffers, for instance the buffers
related to a projectile project.

The name of the current layout appears in the mode-line at the far left (first
element of the mode-line).

To create a new layout type a layout number that does not exist yet.
For instance if you have two layouts currently then type ~SPC l 3~ to create a
third layout.

*** The default layout
The =default= layout (the layout created at the startup of Emacs) is not
displayed in the mode-line but it is possible to display it by setting the
variable =dotspacemacs-display-default-layout= to =t=.

Its name is "default" by default but it can be changed by setting the variable
=dotspacemacs-default-layout-name=.

The =default= layout is special because it has a global scope which means that
all the opened buffers belong to it. So using only the =default= layout feels
like not using layouts at all.

*** Project layouts
A project layout is bound to a projectile project. To create a project layout
use ~SPC p l~.

The name of the layout is the name of the project root directory.

*** Custom Layouts
Custom layouts can be defined using the macro ~spacemacs|define-custom-layout~,
they are accessible via ~SPC l o~.

By convention the name of a custom layout should start with =@=.

Example of custom layout definition for =ERC= buffers:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (spacemacs|define-custom-layout "@ERC"
    :binding "E"
    :body
    (progn
      ;; hook to add all ERC buffers to the layout
      (defun spacemacs-layouts/add-erc-buffer-to-persp ()
        (persp-add-buffer (current-buffer)
                          (persp-get-by-name
                           erc-spacemacs-layout-name)))
      (add-hook 'erc-mode-hook #'spacemacs-layouts/add-erc-buffer-to-persp)
      ;; Start ERC
      (call-interactively 'erc)))
#+END_SRC

Then use ~SPC l o E~ to start ERC inside its own layout. Any new ERC buffer
will be part of the custom layout.

Some custom layouts that ship with Spacemacs:

| Name       | Key Binding | Description                                                                     |
|------------+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| @Spacemacs | ~e~         | Custom perspective containing all buffers of =~/.emacs.d=                       |
| @Mu4e      | ~m~         | Custom perspective containing all mu4e buffers (needs the mu4e layer enabled)   |
| @ERC       | ~E~         | Custom perspective containing all ERC buffers (needs the erc layer enabled)     |
| @RCIRC     | ~i~         | Custom perspective containing all RCIRC buffers (needs the rcirc layer enabled) |
| @Slack     | ~s~         | Custom perspective containing all Slack buffers (needs the slack layer enabled) |
| @Org       | ~o~         | Custom perspective containing all the =org-agenda= buffers                      |

*** Save/Load layouts into a file
With ~SPC l s~ and ~SPC l L~ you can save and load layouts to/from a file.

*Note:* By default, Spacemacs will automatically save the layouts under the name
=persp-auto-save=.

Setting the variable =dotspacemacs-auto-resume-layouts= to =t= will
automatically resume the last saved layouts.

*** Layout key bindings
The key bindings are registered in a transient state. The docstring of the
transient state displays the existing layouts and the currently active
layout has square brackets. Pressing a layout number will activate it (or
create a new one) and exit the transient state. It is possible to just preview a
layout with ~Ctrl-<number>~. Pressing ~TAB~ will activate the previously
selected layout.

| ~X~          | kill other layouts with their buffers                      |

** Workspaces
Workspaces are sub-layouts, they allow to define multiple layouts into a given
layout, those layouts share the same buffer as the parent layout.

The currently active workspace number is displayed before the window number,
for instance "➊|➍" or "1|4" means the fourth window of the first workspace.

Any new layout comes with a default workspace which is the workspace 1.

Switching to a workspace that does not exist in the current layout will create a
new one. For instance at startup you can press ~SPC l w 2~ to create the
workspace 2 in the =default= layout.

When created a workspace is anonymous, you can give them a name with
~SPC l w R~.

*** Workspace key bindings
The key bindings are registered in a transient state. The docstring of the
transient state displays the existing workspaces and the currently active
workspace has square brackets. Pressing a workspace number will activate it (or
create a new one) and exit the transient state. It is possible to just preview a
workspace with ~Ctrl-<number>~. Pressing ~TAB~ will activate the previously
selected workspace.

| Key Binding       | Description                                                 |
|-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC l w~         | activate the transient state                                |
| ~?~               | toggle the documentation                                    |
| ~[0..9]~          | switch to nth workspace                                     |
| ~[C-0..C-9]~      | switch to nth workspace and keep the transient state active |
| ~TAB~             | switch to last active workspace                             |
| ~d~               | close current workspace                                     |
| ~n~ or ~l~        | switch to next workspace                                    |
| ~N~ or ~p~ or ~h~ | switch to previous workspace                                |
| ~R~               | set a tag to the current workspace                          |
| ~w~               | switched to tagged workspace                                |

There are also some handy globally available key bindings related to workspaces:

| Key Binding | Description                          |
|-------------+--------------------------------------|
| ~gt~        | go to next workspace                 |
| ~gT~        | go to previous workspace             |
| ~SPC b W~   | go to workspace and window by buffer |

* Commands
** Vim key bindings
Spacemacs is based on =Vim= modal user interface to navigate and edit text. If
you are not familiar with the =Vim= way of editing text you can try the
[[https://github.com/syl20bnr/evil-tutor][evil-tutor]] lessons by pressing ~SPC h T~ at any time.

*** Escaping
Spacemacs uses [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/evil-escape][evil-escape]] to
easily switch between =insert state= and =normal state= by quickly pressing the
~fd~ keys.

The choice of ~fd~ was made to be able to use the same sequence to escape from
"everything" in Emacs:
  - escape from all stock evil states to normal state
  - escape from evil-lisp-state to normal state
  - escape from evil-iedit-state to normal state
  - abort evil ex command
  - quit minibuffer
  - abort isearch
  - quit magit buffers
  - quit help buffers
  - quit apropos buffers
  - quit ert buffers
  - quit undo-tree buffer
  - quit paradox
  - quit gist-list menu
  - quit helm-ag-edit
  - hide neotree buffer

If you find yourself in a buffer where the Spacemacs (~SPC~) or Vim keybindings
don't work you can use this to get back to =normal state= (for example in ~SPC
SPC customize~ press ~fd~ to make ~SPC b b~ work again).

This sequence can be customized in your =~/.spacemacs=.
Example to set it to ~jj~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
  (setq-default evil-escape-key-sequence "jj"))
#+END_SRC

*Note*: Although ~jj~ or ~jk~ are popular choices of vim users, these key
sequences are not optimal for Spacemacs. Indeed it is very easy in =visual
state= to press quickly ~jj~ and inadvertently escape to =normal state=.

*** Executing Vim and Emacs ex/M-x commands

| Command          | Key Binding |
|------------------+-------------|
| Vim (ex-command) | ~:~         |
| Emacs (M-x)      | ~SPC SPC~   |

The emacs command key ~SPC~ (executed after the leader key) can be changed
with the variable =dotspacemacs-emacs-command-key= of your =~/.spacemacs=.

*** Leader key
On top of =Vim= modes (modes are called states in Spacemacs) there is a
special key called the leader key which once pressed gives a whole new keyboard
layer. The leader key is by default ~SPC~ (space). It is possible to change this
key with the variable =dotspacemacs-leader-key=.

*** Major Mode leader key
Key bindings specific to the current =major mode= start with ~SPC m~. For
convenience a shortcut key called the major mode leader key is set by default on
~​,​~ which saves one precious keystroke.

It is possible to change the major mode leader key by defining the variable
=dotspacemacs-major-mode-leader-key= in your =~/.spacemacs=. For example to
setup the key on tabulation:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-major-mode-leader-key "<tab>")
#+END_SRC

*** Additional text objects
Additional text objects are defined in Spacemacs:

| Object  | Description                |
|---------+----------------------------|
| ~a~     | an argument                |
| ~g~     | the entire buffer          |
| ~$~     | text between =$=           |
| ~*~     | text between =*=           |
| ~8~     | text between =/*= and =*/= |
| ~%~     | text between =%=           |
| ~\vert~ | text between =\vert=       |

** Reserved prefix command for user
~SPC o~ and ~SPC m o~ are reserved for the user. Setting key bindings behind
these is *guaranteed* to never conflict with Spacemacs default key bindings.

*Example:* Put =(spacemacs/set-leader-keys "oc" 'org-capture)= inside
=dotspacemacs/user-config= in your =~/.spacemacs= file, to be able to use
~SPC o c~ to run org mode capture.

** Completion
Spacemacs is powered by one of two incremental completion and selection
narrowing frameworks: [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] (default) or [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy]]. To use Ivy, add the =ivy= layer to
your list of enabled layers. If the =ivy= layer is not enabled, Helm will be
enabled automatically. (Please note that, as Helm is the more mature of the two,
some functions may be unavailable if you choose Ivy.)

These completion systems are the central control towers of Spacemacs, they are
used to manage buffers, projects, search results, configuration layers, toggles
and more...

Mastering your choice of completion system will make you a Spacemacs power user.

For more information go to the layers documentation for [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/layers/+completion/helm/README.org][Helm]] and [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/layers/+completion/ivy/README.org][Ivy]].

*Note:* To open the Spacemacs documentation for Helm of Ivy in Emacs, open the
=spacemacs-help= menu with ~SPC h SPC~ and type ~helm~ or ~ivy~ then ~return~.

*** Ivy
If you choose =ivy= as completion system, make sure to read [[http://oremacs.com/swiper/][official manual]]. In
case you don't want to read everything, at least familiarise with [[http://oremacs.com/swiper/#minibuffer-key-bindings][minibuffer key
bindings]]. Some useful key bindings are presented in following table.

| Key Binding    | Description                                                                                          |
|----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~C-m~ or ~RET~ | call default action on current candidate                                                             |
| ~M-o~          | show the list of valid actions on current candidate (then press any of described keys to execute it) |
| ~C-M-m~        | the same as ~RET~ but doesn't close completion minibuffer                                            |
| ~C-M-o~        | the same as ~M-o~ but doesn't close completion minibuffer                                            |
| ~C-'~          | use avy to quickly select completion on current page (sometimes faster than using arrows)            |

** Discovering
*** Key bindings
**** Which-key
A help buffer is displayed each time the ~SPC~ key is pressed in normal mode.
It lists the available key bindings and their associated commands.

By default the [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] buffer will be displayed quickly after the key has been
pressed. You can change the delay by setting the variable
=dotspacemacs-which-key-delay= to your liking (the value is in second).

**** Describe key bindings
It is possible to search for specific key bindings by pressing ~SPC ?~.

To narrow the list to some key bindings using the leader key type a pattern like
this regular expression: ~SPC\ b~ which would list all =buffer= related
bindings.

*** Getting help
=Describe functions= are powerful Emacs introspection commands to get
information about functions, variables, modes etc. These commands are bound
thusly:

| Key Binding | Description                                               |

*** Available layers
All layers can be easily discovered via =spacemacs-help= accessible with
 ~SPC h SPC~.

The following actions on the selected candidate are available:
  - default: open the layer =README.org=
  - 2nd: open the layer =packages.el=

**** Available packages in Spacemacs
=spacemacs-help= also lists all the packages available in Spacemacs. The
entry format is =(layer) packages=. If you type =flycheck= you'll be able to see
all the layers where =flycheck= is used.

The following actions are available on selected package:
  - default: go the package init function

**** New packages from ELPA repositories
=package-list-packages= is where you can browse for all available packages in the
different Elpa repositories. It is possible to upgrade packages from there but
it is not recommended, use the =[Update Packages]= link on the Spacemacs startup
page instead.

Spacemacs uses [[https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/paradox][Paradox]] instead of =package-list-packages= to list available
ELPA packages. Paradox enhances the package list buffer with better feedbacks,
new filters and Github information like the number of stars. Optionally you can
also star packages directly in the buffer.

*Important Note 1*: Installing a new package from =Paradox= won't make it
persistent. To install a package persistently you have to add it explicitly to a
configuration layer.

*Important Note 2*: Don't /update/ your packages from =Paradox= or
=package-list-packages= because they don't support the rollback feature of
Spacemacs.

*** Toggles
=spacemacs-help= is also a central place to discover the available toggles.
To display only the toggles source press ~C-l~.

The following actions are available on selected toggle:
  - default: toggle on/off

** Navigating
*** Point/Cursor
Navigation is performed using the Vi key bindings ~hjkl~.

| Key Binding | Description                                                                       |

| ~SPC t -~   | lock the cursor at the center of the screen                                       |

**** Smooth scrolling
[[https://github.com/aspiers/smooth-scrolling][smooth-scrolling]] prevent the point to jump when it reaches the top or
bottom of the screen. It is enabled by default.

On Windows, you may want to disable it. To disable the smooth scrolling set the
=dotspacemacs-smooth-scrolling= variable in your =~/.spacemacs= to =nil=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-smooth-scrolling nil)
#+END_SRC

You can also toggle smooth scrolling with ~SPC t v~.

*** Vim motions with avy
Spacemacs uses the =evil= integration of [[https://github.com/abo-abo/avy][avy]] which enables the
invocation of =avy= during motions.

For instance, it is useful for deleting a set of visual lines from the current line.
Try the following sequence in a buffer containing some text: ~d SPC j l~, followed by
selecting an avy candidate.

| Key Binding | Description                                        |
|-------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC j b~   | go back to the previous location (before the jump) |
| ~SPC j j~   | initiate avy jump char                             |
| ~SPC j w~   | initiate avy jump word                             |
| ~SPC j l~   | initiate avy jump line                             |

**** ace-link mode
Similar to =avy=, [[https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-link][ace-link]] allows one to jump to any link in
=help-mode= and =info-mode= with two key strokes.

| Key Binding | Description                                           |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| ~o~         | initiate ace link mode in =help-mode= and =info-mode= |

*** Unimpaired bindings
Spacemacs comes with a built-in port of [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired][tpope's vim-unimpaired]].

This plugin provides several pairs of bracket maps using ~[~ to denote
previous, and ~]~ as next.

| KeyBindings | Description                      |
|-------------+----------------------------------|
| ~[ SPC~     | Insert space above               |

**** Golden ratio
If you resize windows like crazy you may want to give a try to [[https://github.com/roman/golden-ratio.el][golden-ratio]].

=golden-ratio= resizes windows dynamically depending on whether they are
selected or not. By default =golden-ratio= is off.

The mode can be toggled on and off with ~SPC t g~.

*** Buffers and Files
**** Buffers manipulation key bindings
Buffer manipulation commands (start with ~b~):

| Key Binding     | Description                                                              |

| ~SPC b N n~ | create new empty buffer in current window             |

**** Buffers manipulation transient state
A convenient buffer manipulation transient state allows to quickly cycles through
the opened buffer and kill them.

| Key Binding   | Description                                   |
|---------------+-----------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC b .~     | initiate transient state                      |

| ~n~           | go to next buffer (avoid special buffers)     |
| ~N~           | go to previous buffer (avoid special buffers) |
| Any other key | leave the transient state                     |

**** Special Buffers
Unlike vim, emacs creates many buffers that most people do not need to see. Some
examples are the =*Messages*= and =*Compile-Log*= buffers. Spacemacs tries to
automatically ignore buffers that are not useful. However, you may want to
change the way Spacemacs marks buffers as useful. For instructions, see the
[[file:FAQ.org::#change-special-buffer-rules][special buffer howto]].

*** NeoTree file tree
Spacemacs provides a quick and simple way to navigate in an unknown project
file tree with [[https://github.com/jaypei/emacs-neotree][NeoTree]].

To toggle the =NeoTree= buffer press ~SPC f t~ or ~SPC p t~ (the latter open
NeoTree with the root set to the projectile project root).

The NeoTree window always has the number =0= so it does not shift the current
number of the other windows. To select the NeoTree window you then use ~SPC 0~.

VCS integration is supported, the file color will change depending on its
current state. With default =spacemacs-dark= theme:
- green: new file
- purple: modified file

**** NeoTree navigation
Navigation is centered on the ~hjkl~ keys with the hope of providing a fast
navigation experience like in [[http://ranger.nongnu.org/][ranger]]:

| Key Binding  | Description                                                                   |
|--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~h~          | collapse expanded directory or go to parent node                              |
| ~H~          | select previous sibling                                                       |
| ~j~          | select next file or directory                                                 |
| ~J~          | select next expanded directory on level down                                  |
| ~k~          | select previous file or directory                                             |
| ~K~          | select parent directory, when reaching the root change it to parent directory |
| ~l~ or ~RET~ | expand directory                                                              |
| ~L~          | select next sibling                                                           |
| ~R~          | make a directory the root directory                                           |

*Note*: Point is automatically set to the first letter of a node for a smoother
experience.

**** Opening files with NeoTree
By default a file is opened in the last active window. It is possible to choose
window number where to open a file by using a numeric argument, for instance
~2 l~ or ~2 RET~ will open the current file in window 2. It is also possible to
open the file in a split window with ~|~ and ~-~:

| Key Binding      | Description                               |
|------------------+-------------------------------------------|
| ~l~ or ~RET~     | open file in last active window           |
| ~# l~ or ~# RET~ | open file in window number =#=            |
| ~¦~              | open file in an vertically split window   |
| ~-~              | open file in an horizontally split window |

**** Other NeoTree key bindings

| Key Binding | Description                     |
|-------------+---------------------------------|
| ~TAB~       | toggle stretching of the buffer |
| ~c~         | create a node                   |
| ~C~         | copy a node                     |
| ~d~         | delete a node                   |
| ~gr~        | refresh                         |

| ~q~ or ~fd~ | hide =NeoTree= buffer           |
| ~r~         | rename a node                   |
| ~?~         | show help                       |

**** NeoTree mode-line
The mode-line has the following format =[x/y] d (D:a, F:b)= where:
  - =x= is the index of the current selected file or directory
  - =y= the total number of items (file and directory) in the current directory
  - =d= the name of the current directory
  - =a= the number of directories in the current directory
  - =b= the number of files in the current directory

**** NeoTree Source Control Integration
If you would like NeoTree to show source control information, you can use the
setting =neo-vc-integration=. It is a list containing the possible values:

| Setting | Description                                                               |
|---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =face=  | Show information by changing the color of the file/directory name.        |
| =char=  | Show information with a character to the left of the file/directory name. |

The default is =nil= (do not show source control information), which is recommended.

For example,

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq neo-vc-integration 'face)
#+END_SRC

*Note*: At this time, it is not recommended to set this to anything other
than =nil=.  Otherwise, it will become very slow with larger source trees.
See https://github.com/jaypei/emacs-neotree/issues/126 for more information.

**** NeoTree Theme
You can change the NeoTree theme by using the setting =neo-theme=.  Possible
values are:

| Setting   | Description                                                      |
|-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =classic= | Use an icon to display items - only suitable for gui mode.       |
| =ascii=   | The simplest style, it will use =x=, =-= to display fold status. |
| =arrow=   | Use unicode arrows to display fold status.                       |
| =nerd=    | Use the NERDTree indentation mode and arrows.                    |

The default is =classic=.

Use =nerd= if you want it to look most like NERDTree in VIM.  For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq neo-theme 'nerd)
#+END_SRC

*** Bookmarks
Bookmarks can be set anywhere in a file. Bookmarks are persistent. They are very
useful to jump to/open a known project.

Open the bookmark completion window by pressing= ~SPC f b~

| Key Binding | Description                                  |
|-------------+----------------------------------------------|
| ~C-d~       | delete the selected bookmark                 |
| ~C-e~       | edit the selected bookmark                   |
| ~C-f~       | toggle filename location                     |
| ~C-o~       | open the selected bookmark in another window |

To save a new bookmark, just type the name of the bookmark and press ~RET~.

*** DocView mode
=doc-view-mode= is a built-in major mode to view DVI, PostScript (PS), PDF,
OpenDocument, and Microsoft Office documents.

| ~C-c C-c~   | toggle display text and image display    |
| ~C-c C-t~   | open new buffer with doc's text contents |

** Auto-saving
*** Frequency of auto-saving
By default auto-saving of files is performed every 300 characters and
every 30 seconds of idle time which can be changed by setting to a
new value the variables =auto-save-interval= and =auto-save-timeout=
respectively.

*** Location of auto-saved files
Auto-save of modified files can be performed in-place on the original file
itself /or/ in the cache directory (in this case the original file will remain
unsaved). By default Spacemacs auto-save the file in the cache directory.

To modify the location set the variable =dotspacemacs-auto-save-file-location=
to =original= or =cache=.

Local files are auto-saved in a sub-directory called =site= in the =cache=
directory whereas remote files (i.e. files edited over TRAMP) are auto-saved
in a sub-directory called =dist=.

*** Disable auto-save
To disable auto-saving set the variable =dotspacemacs-auto-save-file-location=
to =nil=.

You can toggle auto-save in a buffer by calling the command =auto-save-mode=.

** Searching
*** With an external tool
Spacemacs can be interfaced with different search utilities like:
  - [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][rg]]
  - [[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher][ag]]
  - [[https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher][pt]]
  - [[https://beyondgrep.com/][ack]]
  - grep

The search commands in Spacemacs are organized under the ~SPC s~ prefix with the
next key is the tool to use and the last key is the scope. For instance
~SPC s a b~ will search in all opened buffers using =ag=.

If the last key (determining the scope) is uppercase then the current region or
symbol under point is used as default input for the search. For instance
~SPC s a B~ will search with symbol under point (if there is no active region).

If the tool key is omitted then a default tool will be automatically selected
for the search. This tool corresponds to the first tool found on the system of
the list =dotspacemacs-search-tools=, the default order is =rg=, =ag=, =pt=,
=ack= then =grep=. For instance ~SPC s b~ will search in the opened buffers
using =pt= if =rg= and =ag= have not been found on the system.

The tool keys are:

| Tool | Key |
|------+-----|
| ag   | a   |
| grep | g   |
| ack  | k   |
| rg   | r   |
| pt   | t   |

The available scopes and corresponding keys are:

| Scope                      | Key |
|----------------------------+-----|
| opened buffers             | b   |
| files in a given directory | f   |
| current project            | p   |

It is possible to search in the current file by double tapping the second key
of the sequence, for instance ~SPC s a a~ will search in the current
file with =ag=.

*Notes*:
- =rg=, =ag= and =pt= are optimized to be used in a source control repository but
  they can be used in an arbitrary directory as well.
- It is also possible to search in several directories at once by marking
  them in the Helm buffer (not available in Ivy).

*Beware* if you use =pt=, [[https://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/doc/trunk/embedded/www/tcllib/files/apps/pt.html][TCL parser tools]] also install a command line tool
called =pt=.

**** Useful key bindings

| Key Binding            | Description                                                  |
|------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~F3~                   | in a completion buffer, save results to a regular buffer     |
| ~SPC r l~              | resume the last =completion= buffer                          |
| ~SPC r s~ or ~SPC s l~ | resume search buffer (completion or converted search buffer) |
| ~SPC s `~              | go back to the previous place before jump                    |
| Prefix argument        | will ask for file extensions                                 |

When results have been saved in a regular buffer with ~F3~, that buffer supports
browsing through the matches with Spacemacs’ =next-error= and =previous-error=
bindings (~SPC e n~ and ~SPC e p~) as well as the error transient state (~SPC e~).

*** Persistent highlighting
Spacemacs uses =evil-search-highlight-persist= to keep the searched expression
highlighted until the next search. It is also possible to clear the highlighting
by pressing ~SPC s c~ or executing the ex command =:noh=.

*** Highlight current symbol
Spacemacs supports highlighting of the current symbol on demand (provided by
[[https://github.com/emacsmirror/auto-highlight-symbol][auto-highlight-symbol]] mode) and adds a transient state to easily navigate and rename
this symbol.

It is also possible to change the range of the navigation on the fly to:
  - buffer
  - function
  - visible area

To initiate the highlighting of the current symbol under point press ~SPC s h~.

Navigation between the highlighted symbols can be done with the commands:

| Key Binding | Description                                                                        |
|-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~*~         | initiate navigation transient state on current symbol and jump forwards            |
| ~#~         | initiate navigation transient state on current symbol and jump backwards           |
| ~SPC s e~   | edit all occurrences of the current symbol(/)                                      |
| ~SPC s h~   | highlight the current symbol and all its occurrence within the current range       |
| ~SPC s H~   | go to the last searched occurrence of the last highlighted symbol                  |
| ~SPC t h a~ | toggle automatic highlight of symbol under point after =ahs-idle-interval= seconds |

In 'Spacemacs' highlight symbol transient state:

| Key Binding   | Description                                                   |
|---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~e~           | edit occurrences (*)                                          |
| ~n~           | go to next occurrence                                         |
| ~N~           | go to previous occurrence                                     |
| ~d~           | go to next definition occurrence                              |
| ~D~           | go to previous definition occurrence                          |
| ~r~           | change range (=function=, =display area=, =whole buffer=)     |
| ~R~           | go to home occurrence (reset position to starting occurrence) |
| Any other key | leave the navigation transient state                          |

(*) using [[https://github.com/tsdh/iedit][iedit]] or the default implementation
of =auto-highlight-symbol=

The transient state text in minibuffer display the following information:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <M> [6/11]* press (n/N) to navigate, (e) to edit, (r) to change range or (R)
    for reset
#+END_EXAMPLE

Where =<M> [x/y]*= is:
  - M: the current range mode
  - =<B>=: whole buffer range
  - =<D>=: current display range
  - =<F>=: current function range
  - =x=: the index of the current highlighted occurrence
  - =y=: the total number of occurrences
  - =*=: appears if there is at least one occurrence which is not currently visible.

*** Visual Star
With [[https://github.com/bling/evil-visualstar][evil-visualstar]] you can search for the next occurrence of the current
selection.

It is pretty useful combined with the [[#expand-region][expand-region]] bindings.

*Note*: If the current state is not the =visual state= then pressing ~*~ uses
auto-highlight-symbol and its transient state.

*** Listing symbols by semantic
To list all the symbols of a buffer press ~SPC s j~

** Editing
*** Paste text
**** Paste Transient-state
The paste transient state can be enabled by settings the variable
=dotspacemacs-enable-paste-transient-state= to =t=. By default it is disabled.

When the transient state is enabled, pressing ~p~ again will replace the pasted text
with the previous yanked (copied) text on the kill ring.

For example if you copy =foo= and =bar= then press ~p~ the text =bar= will
be pasted, pressing ~p~ again will replace =bar= with =foo=.

| Key Binding   | Description                                                                   |
|---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~p~ or ~P~    | paste the text before or after point and initiate the =paste= transient state |
| ~C-j~         | in transient state: replace paste text with the previously copied one         |
| ~C-k~         | in transient state: replace paste text with the next copied one               |
| Any other key | leave the transient state                                                     |

**** Auto-indent pasted text
By default any pasted text will be auto-indented. To paste text un-indented use
the universal argument.

It is possible to disable the auto-indentation for specific major-modes by
adding a major-mode to the variable =spacemacs-indent-sensitive-modes= in your
=dotspacemacs/user-config= function.

*** Text manipulation commands

prefix argument, for instance ~SPC U 24 SPC i p p~  will insert a password
with 24 characters.

*** Smartparens Strict mode
[[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][Smartparens]] comes with a strict mode which prevents deletion of parenthesis if
the result is unbalanced.

This mode can be frustrating for novices, this is why it is not enabled by
default.

It is possible to enable it easily for /all programming modes/ with the variable
=dotspacemacs-smartparens-strict-mode= of you =~/.spacemacs=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-smartparens-strict-mode t)
#+END_SRC

*** Zooming
**** Text
The font size of the current buffer can be adjusted with the commands:

| Key Binding   | Description                                                                    |
|---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC z x +~   | scale up the font and initiate the font scaling transient state                |
| ~SPC z x =~   | scale up the font and initiate the font scaling transient state                |
| ~SPC z x -~   | scale down the font and initiate the font scaling transient state              |
| ~SPC z x 0~   | reset the font size (no scaling) and initiate the font scaling transient state |
| ~+~           | increase the font size                                                         |
| ~=~           | increase the font size                                                         |
| ~-~           | decrease the font size                                                         |
| ~0~           | reset the font size                                                            |
| Any other key | leave the font scaling transient state                                         |

Note that /only/ the text of the current buffer is scaled, the other buffers,
the mode-line and the minibuffer are not affected. To zoom the whole content of
a frame use the =zoom frame= bindings (see next section).

**** Frame
You can zoom in and out the whole content of the frame with the commands:

| Key Binding   | Description                                                                 |
|---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC z f +~   | zoom in the frame content and initiate the frame scaling transient state    |
| ~SPC z f =~   | zoom in the frame content and initiate the frame scaling transient state    |
| ~SPC z f -~   | zoom out the frame content and initiate the frame scaling transient state   |
| ~SPC z f 0~   | reset the frame content size and initiate the frame scaling transient state |
| ~+~           | zoom in                                                                     |
| ~=~           | zoom in                                                                     |
| ~-~           | zoom out                                                                    |
| ~0~           | reset zoom                                                                  |
| Any other key | leave the zoom frame transient state                                        |

*** Increase/Decrease numbers
Spacemacs uses [[https://github.com/cofi/evil-numbers][evil-numbers]] to easily increase or decrease numbers.

| Key Binding | Description                                                         |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC n +~   | increase the number under point by one and initiate transient state |
| ~SPC n -~   | decrease the number under point by one and initiate transient state |

In transient state:

| Key Binding   | Description                            |
|---------------+----------------------------------------|
| ~+~           | increase the number under point by one |
| ~-~           | decrease the number under point by one |
| Any other key | leave the transient state              |

*Tips:* you can increase or decrease a value by more that once by using a prefix
argument (i.e. ~10 SPC n +~ will add 10 to the number under point).

*** Spell checking
Spell checking is enabled by including the [[file:../layers/+checkers/spell-checking/README.org][spell
checking]] layer in your dotfile.

Keybindings are listed in the layer documentation.

*** Region selection
Vi =Visual= modes are all supported by =evil=.

**** Expand-region
Spacemacs adds another =Visual= mode via the [[https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el][expand-region]] mode.

| Key Binding | Description                              |
|-------------+------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC v~     | initiate expand-region mode then...      |
| ~v~         | expand the region by one semantic unit   |
| ~V~         | contract the region by one semantic unit |
| ~r~         | reset the region to initial selection    |
| ~ESC~       | leave expand-region mode                 |

**** Indent text object
With [[https://github.com/TheBB/evil-indent-plus][evil-indent-plus]] the following text objects are available:

- ~ii~ - Inner Indentation: the surrounding textblock with the same indentation
- ~iI~ - Above and Indentation: ~ii~ + the line above with a different indentation
- ~iJ~ - Above, Below and Indentation+: ~iI~ + the line below with a different indentation

There are also ~a~ variants that include whitespace. Example (=|= indicates point):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (while (not done)
    (messa|ge "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."))
  (1+ 41)
#+END_SRC

-  ~vii~ will select the line with message
-  ~viI~ will select the whole while loop
-  ~viJ~ will select the whole fragment

*** Region narrowing
The displayed text of a buffer can be narrowed with the commands (start with
~n~):

| Key Binding | Description                               |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC n f~   | narrow the buffer to the current function |
| ~SPC n p~   | narrow the buffer to the visible page     |
| ~SPC n r~   | narrow the buffer to the selected text    |
| ~SPC n w~   | widen, i.e. show the whole buffer again   |

*** Replacing text with iedit
Spacemacs uses the powerful [[https://github.com/tsdh/iedit][iedit]] mode through [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/evil-iedit-state][evil-iedit-state]] to quickly
edit multiple occurrences of a symbol or selection.

=evil-iedit-state= defines two new evil states:
  - =iedit state=
  - =iedit-insert state=

The color code for these states is =red=.

=evil-iedit-state= has also a nice integration with [[https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el][expand-region]] for quick
editing of the currently selected text by pressing ~e~.

**** iedit states key bindings
***** State transitions

| Key Binding | From             | To     |
|-------------+------------------+--------|
| ~SPC s e~   | normal or visual | iedit  |
| ~e~         | expand-region    | iedit  |
| ~ESC~       | iedit            | normal |
| ~C-g~       | iedit            | normal |
| ~fd~        | iedit            | normal |
| ~ESC~       | iedit-insert     | iedit  |
| ~C-g~       | iedit-insert     | normal |
| ~fd~        | iedit-insert     | normal |

To sum-up, in =iedit-insert state= you have to press ESC twice to go back to the
=normal state=. You can also at any time press ~C-g~ or ~fd~ to return to =normal
state=.

*Note*: evil commands which switch to =insert state= will switch in
=iedit-insert state=.

***** In iedit state
=iedit state= inherits from =normal state=, the following key bindings are
specific to =iedit state=.

***** In iedit-insert state

| Key Binding | Description               |
|-------------+---------------------------|
| ~ESC~       | go back to =iedit state=  |
| ~C-g~       | go back to =normal state= |

**** Examples
-  manual selection of several words then replace: ~v w w SPC s e S "toto" ESC ESC~
-  append text to a word on two lines: ~v i w SPC s e J i "toto" ESC ESC~
-  substitute symbol /with expand-region/: ~SPC v v e S "toto" ESC ESC~
-  replace symbol with yanked (copied) text /with expand region/:
   ~SPC v e p ESC ESC~

*** Replacing text in several files
If you have =rg=, =ag=, =pt= or =ack= installed, replacing an occurrence of text
in several files can be performed via [[https://github.com/syohex/emacs-helm-ag][helm-ag]].

Say you want to replace all =foo= occurrences by =bar= in your current
project:
  - initiate a search with ~SPC /~
  - enter in edit mode with ~C-c C-e~
  - go to the occurrence and enter in =iedit state= with ~SPC s e~
  - edit the occurrences then leave the =iedit state=
  - press ~C-c C-c~

*Note*: In Spacemacs, =helm-ag= despite its name works with =rg=, =pt= and =ack=
as well (but not with =grep=).

*** Renaming files in a directory
It is possible to batch rename files in a directory using =wdired= from an
=helm= session:
- browse for a directory using ~SPC f f~
- enter =wdired= with ~C-c C-e~
- edit the file names and use ~C-c C-c~ to confirm the changes
- use ~C-c C-k~ to abort any changes

*** Commenting
Comments are handled by [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/evil-nerd-commenter][evil-nerd-commenter]], it's bound to the following keys.

| Key Binding | Description               |
|-------------+---------------------------|
| ~SPC ;~     | comment operator          |
| ~SPC c h~   | hide/show comments        |
| ~SPC c l~   | comment lines             |
| ~SPC c L~   | invert comment lines      |
| ~SPC c p~   | comment paragraphs        |
| ~SPC c P~   | invert comment paragraphs |
| ~SPC c t~   | comment to line           |
| ~SPC c T~   | invert comment to line    |
| ~SPC c y~   | comment and yank          |
| ~SPC c Y~   | invert comment and yank   |

*Tips:* To comment efficiently a block of line use the combo ~SPC ; SPC j l~

*** Regular expressions
Spacemacs uses the packages [[https://github.com/joddie/pcre2el][pcre2el]] to manipulate regular expressions. It is
useful when working with =Emacs Lisp= buffers since it allows to easily converts
=PCRE= (Perl Compatible RegExp) to Emacs RegExp or =rx=. It can also be used to
"explain" a PCRE RegExp around point in =rx= form.

The key bindings start with ~SPC x r~ and have the following mnemonic structure:

- ~SPC x r <source> <target>~ convert from source to target
- ~SPC x r~ do what I mean

| Key Binding   | Function                                                                               |
|---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC x r /~   | Explain the regexp around point with =rx=                                              |
| ~SPC x r '​~   | Generate strings given by a regexp given this list is finite                           |
| ~SPC x r t~   | Replace regexp around point by the =rx= form or vice versa                             |
| ~SPC x r x~   | Convert regexp around point in =rx= form  and display the result in the minibuffer     |
| ~SPC x r c~   | Convert regexp around point to the other form and display the result in the minibuffer |
| ~SPC x r e /~ | Explain Emacs Lisp regexp                                                              |
| ~SPC x r e '​~ | Generate strings from Emacs Lisp regexp                                                |
| ~SPC x r e p~ | Convert Emacs Lisp regexp to PCRE                                                      |
| ~SPC x r e t~ | Replace Emacs Lisp regexp by =rx= form or vice versa                                   |
| ~SPC x r e x~ | Convert Emacs Lisp regexp to =rx= form                                                 |
| ~SPC x r p /~ | Explain PCRE regexp                                                                    |
| ~SPC x r p '​~ | Generate strings from PCRE regexp                                                      |
| ~SPC x r p e~ | Convert PCRE regexp to Emacs Lisp                                                      |
| ~SPC x r p x~ | Convert PCRE to =rx= form                                                              |

*** Deleting files
Deletion is configured to send deleted files to system trash.

On OS X the =trash= program is required. It can be installed with [[https://brew.sh/][homebrew]] with
the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ brew install trash
#+END_SRC

To disable the trash you can set the variable =delete-by-moving-to-trash= to
=nil= in your =~/.spacemacs=.

*** Editing Lisp code
Editing of lisp code is provided by [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/evil-lisp-state][evil-lisp-state]].

Commands will set the current state to =lisp state= where different commands
combo can be repeated without pressing on ~SPC k~.

When in =lisp state= the color of the mode-line changes to pink.

Examples:
  - to slurp three times while in normal state: ~SPC k 3 s~
  - to wrap a symbol in parentheses then slurp two times: ~SPC k w 2 s~

*Note*: The =lisp state= commands are available in /any/ modes! Try it out.

*** Mouse usage
There are some added mouse features set for the line number margin (if shown):

- single click in line number margin visually selects the entire line
- drag across line number margin visually selects the region
- double click in line number margin visually select the current code block

** Managing projects
Projects in Spacemacs are managed with [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]]. In =projectile= projects
are defined implicitly, for instance the root of a project is found when a
=.git= repository or =.projectile= file is encountered in the file tree.

To search in a project see [[#searching-in-a-project][project searching]].

=projectile= commands start with p:

*Note for Windows Users*: To enable fast indexing the GNU ~find~ or
Cygwin ~find~ must be in your ~PATH~.

** Registers
Access commands to the various registers start with =r=:

| Key Binding | Description                        |
|-------------+------------------------------------|
| ~SPC r e~   | show evil yank and named registers |
| ~SPC r m~   | show marks register                |
| ~SPC r r~   | show helm register                 |
| ~SPC r y~   | show kill ring                     |

** Errors handling
Spacemacs uses [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][Flycheck]] to gives error feedback on the fly. The checks are
only performed at save time by default.

Errors management commands (start with ~e~):

| Key Binding | Description                                                           |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC t s~   | toggle flycheck                                                       |
| ~SPC e c~   | clear all errors                                                      |
| ~SPC e h~   | describe a flycheck checker                                           |
| ~SPC e l~   | toggle the display of the =flycheck= list of errors/warnings          |
| ~SPC e n~   | go to the next error                                                  |
| ~SPC e p~   | go to the previous error                                              |
| ~SPC e v~   | verify flycheck setup (useful to debug 3rd party tools configuration) |
| ~SPC e .~   | error transient state                                                 |

The next/previous error bindings and the error transient state can be used to
browse errors from flycheck as well as errors from compilation buffers, and
indeed anything that supports Emacs’ =next-error= API. This includes for example
search results that have been saved to a separate buffer.

Custom fringe bitmaps:

| Symbol                   | Description |
|--------------------------+-------------|
| [[file:img/dot-error.png]]   | Error       |
| [[file:img/dot-warning.png]] | warning     |
| [[file:img/dot-info.png]]    | Info        |

** Compiling
Spacemacs binds a few commands to support compiling a project.

   | Key Binding | Description                    |
   |-------------+--------------------------------|
   | ~SPC c c~   | use =helm-make= via projectile |
   | ~SPC c C~   | compile                        |
   | ~SPC c d~   | close compilation window       |
   | ~SPC c k~   | kill compilation               |
   | ~SPC c m~   | =helm-make=                    |
   | ~SPC c r~   | recompile                      |

* Emacs Server
Spacemacs starts a server at launch. This server is killed whenever you close
your Emacs windows.

** Connecting to the Emacs server
You can open a file in Emacs from the terminal using =emacsclient=. Use
=emacsclient -c= to open the file in Emacs GUI. Use =emacsclient -t= to open the
file in Emacs within the terminal.

If you want your Linux/OS X system to use Emacs by default for any prompt, you
need to set it in your shell configuration, e.g. =~/.bashrc= or =~/.zshrc=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh-mode
export EDITOR="emacsclient -c"
#+END_SRC

Note that if you're on OS X, you may have to refer to the emacsclient that comes
with your GUI Emacs, e.g.:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh-mode
export EDITOR="/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient -c"
#+END_SRC

Tip: Remember to use ~:wq~ or ~C-x #~ after you are done editing the file in
Emacs.

See [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html][Emacs as a Server]] in the official Emacs manual for more details.

** Keeping the server alive
It is possible to keep the server alive when you close Emacs by setting the
variable =dotspacemacs-persistent-server= to =t= in your =~./spacemacs=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-persistent-server t)
#+END_SRC

When this variable is set to =t=, the only way to quit Emacs /and/ kill the
server is to use the following bindings:

| Keybinding | Description                                                              |
|------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC q q~  | Quit Emacs and kill the server, prompt for changed buffers to save       |
| ~SPC q Q~  | Quit Emacs and kill the server, lose all unsaved changes.                |
| ~SPC q r~  | Restart both Emacs and the server, prompting to save any changed buffers |
| ~SPC q s~  | Save the buffers, quit Emacs and kill the server                         |
| ~SPC q f~  | Kill the current frame                                                   |

* Troubleshoot
** Loading fails
If any errors happen during the loading the mode-line will turn red and the
errors should appear inline in the startup buffer. Spacemacs should still be
usable; if it is not then restart Emacs with =emacs --debug-init= and open a
[[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues][Github issue]] with the backtrace.

** Upgrading/Downgrading Emacs version
To ensure that packages are correctly compiled for the new Emacs version you
installed, be sure to run the interactive command =spacemacs/recompile-elpa=
with ~SPC SPC spacemacs/recompile-elpa~.
