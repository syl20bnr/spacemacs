* Core Pillars
Four core pillars: Mnemonic, Discoverability, Consistency, "Crowd-Configured".

If any of these core pillars is violated open an issue and we'll fix it.

** Mnemonic
=Spacemacs= organizes key bindings by mnemonic namespaces as much as possible. If
you are looking for commands to operate on your buffer, they are right under ~SPC
b~, if you want to operate on your project, then it is ~SPC p~, etc...

** Discoverability
=Spacemacs= comes with a dedicated major mode =spacemacs-mode=. Its goal is to give
useful feedbacks and easily perform maintenance tasks.

It also comes with dedicated [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] sources to quickly find layers, packages and
more.

[[https://github.com/kai2nenobu/guide-key][guide-key]] is enabled by default, it will display all the available key bindings
in a dedicated popup buffer.

** Consistency
Similar functionalities should have the same key binding no matter which major
is currently active. For instance if you are looking for the definition of a
function, the binding is ~SPC m g g~, =m= for =major mode= and =g g= for =go to thing at
point=. No matter what is the major mode it is the same binding to perform this
action.

This is also true for the documentation, each configuration layer comes with an
associated =README.org= file with the same base layout.

The consistency core pillar is supported by a convention file: [[file:CONVENTIONS.org][CONVENTIONS.org]]

** Crowd-Configured
By defining an very light structure called =configuration layer= which is easy to
understand, =Spacemacs= makes it easy to contribute additional support.

The conventions in [[file:CONVENTIONS.org][CONVENTIONS.org]] make it easy to get the spacemacs way and
keep consistency even if there are a lot of contributions.

=Crowd-configuration= is the most powerful pillar of =Spacemacs=. Anybody can submit
upstream improvements to configuration layers or a whole new one. Any user can
easily and directly use this layer by adding it to a list in a dotfile. It is
even possible to exclude /any/ unwanted packages.

* Goals
-  *Bring the power of modal editing* to the powerful Emacs editing platform.

-  Integrate nicely with =Evil= states (=Vim= modes): =Spacemacs= tries to *keep
   your fingers on the home row* as much as possible, no matter the mode you are
   in.

-  *Crowd-configured*: Contribute easily your improvements and new configuration
   layers.

-  *Minimalistic and nice graphical UI*, keep your available screen space for
   what matters: your text files.

-  *Mnemonic and consistent key bindings* which should be easier to learn and
   remember and be the same in all major modes.

-  *Fast boot time*, everything is lazy-loaded.

-  *Lower the risk of RSI* by heavily using the space bar instead of modifiers.

-  Hopefully, if it's not already the case:

    Ɛ>Ɛ>Ɛ> *make you love modal editing!* <3<3<3

* Screenshots
/Startup/ [[file:img/spacemacs-startup.png]]

/Python/ [[file:img/spacemacs-python.png]]

/Terminal (urxvt)/ [[file:img/spacemacs-urxvt.png]]

/Note: Even though screenshots are updated frequently, =Spacemacs= is evolving
quickly and the screenshots may not reflect exactly the current state of the
project./

* Who can benefit from this?
=Spacemacs= is first intended to be used by *Vim users* who want to go to the
next level by using Emacs. There is a [[./VIMUSERS.org][guide]] for these users to supplement the
documentation.

It is also a good fit for people wanting to *lower the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury][risk of RSI]]* induced by
the default Emacs key bindings (this is an assumption, there is no official
studies to prove this).

Emacs users wanting to learn *a different way to edit files* or wanting to learn
Vim key bindings.

As a side note, if you are a programmer and you don't know Vim key bindings yet,
I deeply recommend you to learn the basics as recommended in [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/05/how-to-learn-emacs-a-hand-drawn-one-pager-for-beginners/][Sacha Chua's
one-page guide]] about how to learn Emacs.

* Update and Rollback
For now it is still needed to update the =Spacemacs= repository manually.

** Update Spacemacs repository
Close Emacs and update the git repository:

#+begin_src sh
  $ git pull --rebase git submodule sync; git submodule update
#+end_src

*Note* It is recommended to update the packages first, see next session.

** Update packages
To update =Spacemacs= press RET (enter) or click on the link =[Update]= in the
startup page under the banner then restart Emacs.

If anything goes wrong you should be able to rollback the update by pressing
~RET~ or clicking on the =[Rollback]= link next to the =[Update]= link and
choose a rollback slot (sorted by date).

* Configuration layers
** Structure
Configuration is organized in layers. Each layer has the following structure:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    [layer_name]
      |__ [extensions]
      | |__ [mode 1]
      | |     ...
      | |__ [mode n]
      |__ config.el
      |__ extensions.el
      |__ funcs.el
      |__ keybindings.el
      |__ packages.el

    [] = directory
#+END_EXAMPLE

Where:

      | File           | Usage                                                                |
      |----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | config.el      | Emacs built-in configuration or mandatory configuration              |
      | extensions.el  | The list of extensions to load and the functions to initialize them  |
      | funcs.el       | Various functions and macros (often used in keybindings.el)          |
      | keybindings.el | Emacs built-in key bindings or mandatory key bindings                |
      | packages.el    | The list of packages to install and the functions to initialize them |

=Packages= are =ELPA= packages which can be installed from an =ELPA= compliant
repository, and =Extensions= are generally elisp code from git submodules.

** Extensions and Packages
*** Within a layer
**** Declaration

=Extensions= and =Packages= are declared in variables =<layer>-pre-extensions=,
=<layer>-post-extensions= and =<layer>-packages= where =<layer>= is the layer
name. =Pre-Extensions= are loaded before =Packages= and =Post-Extensions= are
loaded after =Packages=.

They are processed in alphabetical order so sometimes you'll have to use some
=eval-after-load= black magic.

Example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq <layer>-packages '(package1 package2 ...)
#+end_src

**** Initialization
To initialize an extension or a package =xxx=, define a function with this
format in =extensions.el= or =packages.el=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (defun <layer>/init-xxx () ...body )
#+end_src

It is common to define the body with the [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] macro.

**** Exclusion
It is possible to exclude some packages from =Spacemacs= in a per layer basis.
This is useful when a configuration layer aims to replace a stock package
declared in the =Spacemacs= layer.

To do so add the package names to exclude to the variable
=<layer>-excluded-packages=.

Example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq <layer>-excluded-packages '(package1 package2 ...)
#+end_src

*** Without a layer
Sometimes a layer can be an unnecessary overhead, this is the case if you just
want to install a package without any configuration associated to it. A good
example is some niche language where you are only interested syntax
highlighting.

You can install such packages by adding them to the variable
=dotspacemacs-additional-packages= in your dotfile.

If you want to add some configuration for them then consider to create a layer,
or just put the configuration in the =dotspacemacs/config= function.

Example to install =llvm-mode= and =dts-mode=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq dotspacemacs-additional-packages '(llvm-mode dts-mode)
#+end_src

** Packages synchronization (Vundle like feature)
=Spacemacs= features a synchronization engine for the ELPA packages. It means
that =Spacemacs= will auto-install the new packages in =<layer>-packages= lists
/and/ auto-delete orphan packages in your =elpa= directory.

It effectively makes =Spacemacs= behave like [[https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim][Vundle]].

** Types of configuration layers
There are three types of configuration layers:
  - core (this is the =Spacemacs= layer)
  - private (in the =private= directory, they are ignored by Git)
  - contrib (in the =contrib= directory, those layers are contributions shared
    by the community and merged upstream).

** Submitting a configuration layer upstream
If you decide to provide a =contrib= configuration layer, please check the
contribution guidelines in [[./CONTRIBUTE.org][CONTRIBUTE.org]].

** Example: Themes Megapack example
This is a simple =contrib= configuration layer listing a bunch of themes, you
can find it [[../contrib/themes-megapack][here]].

To install it, just add =themes-megapack= to your =~/.spacemacs= like so:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(themes-megapack))
#+end_src

You have now installed around 100 themes you are free to try with ~SPC T h~
(helm-themes).

** Managing private configuration layers
=Spacemacs= configuration system is flexible enough to let you manage your
private layers in different ways.

*** Using the private directory
Everything in the private directory is ignored by Git so it is a good place to
store private layers. There is a huge drawback to this approach though: /your
layers are not source controlled/.

*** Using an external Git repository
This is the recommended way to manage your private layers.

The best approach is to store all your private layers into an external Git
repository. It is especially a good practice to store them in your =dotfiles=
repository if you have one. Put also your =~/.spacemacs= file in it.

Then you are free to symlink your layers into =~/emacs.d/private= /or/ let them
anywhere you want and reference the parent directory in the variable
=dotspacemacs-configuration-layer-path= of your =~/.spacemacs=.

Note that you could also have a dedicated repository for all your private layers
and then directly clone this repository in =~/.emacs.d/private=.

*** Using a personal branch
The final main way to manage your private layers is to push them in a personal
branch that you keep up to date with upstream =master= or =develop=.

* Dotfile Configuration

User configuration can be stored in your =~/.spacemacs= file.

** Installation
=~/.spacemacs= is an optional file. If you want to use it you have to copy it
manually from the template file =~/.emacs.d/core/templates/.spacemacs.template=

#+begin_src sh
    $ cp ~/.emacs.d/core/templates/.spacemacs.template ~/.spacemacs
#+end_src

** Synchronization of dotfile changes
To apply the modifications made in =~/.spacemacs= press ~SPC f e R~. It will
re-execute the =Spacemacs= initialization process.

*Note:* A synchronization re-execute the functions =dotspacemacs/init= and
=dotspacemacs/config=. Depending on the content of this functions you may
encounter some unwanted side effects. For instance if you use a toggle in
=dotspacemac/config= to enable some behavior, this behavior will be turned off
whenever the dotfile is re-synchronize. To avoid these side-effects it is
recommended to use =setq= expressions instead of toggle functions. It is also
possible to /skip/ the execution of =dotspacemacs/config= with the universal
argument (~SPC u SPC f e R~).

** Content
*** Using configuration layers
To use a configuration layer, add it to the =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers=
variable of your =~/.spacemacs=.

For instance to add the configuration layer of [[#thank-you][RMS]]:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(rms))
#+end_src

If this layer does not exist you can still try another one in [[../contrib][the =contrib=
directory]].

Configuration layers are expected to be stored in =~/.emacs.d/private= or
=~/.emacs.d/contrib=. But you are free to keep them somewhere else by declaring
additional paths where =Spacemacs= can look for configuration layers. This is
done by setting the list =dotspacemacs-configuration-layer-path= in your
=~/.spacemacs=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layer-path '("~/.myconfig/"))
#+end_src

*** Setting configuration layers variables
Some configuration layers have configuration variables to enable specific
support. For instance the [[../contrib/!tools/git][git layer]] has several configuration variables, they
can be set directly in the =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= like this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun dotspacemacs/layers ()
    ;; List of configuration layers to load.
    (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(auto-completion
                                                      (git :variables
                                                           git-magit-status-fullscreen t)
                                                      smex)))
#+end_src

*** Excluding packages
You can exclude packages you don't want to install with the variable
=dotspacemacs-excluded-packages=, this variable can exclude both packages and
extensions (see [[#configuration-layers][Configuration layers]] for more info on packages and extensions).

For instance to disable the =rainbow-delimiters= package:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq-default dotspacemacs-excluded-packages '(rainbow-delimiters))
#+end_src

When you exclude a package, =Spacemacs= will automatically delete it for you the
next time you launch Emacs. All the orphan dependencies are as well delete
automatically.

*** Hooks
Two special functions of the =~/.spacemacs= file can be used to perform
configuration at the beginning and end of =Spacemacs= loading process.

  - =dotspacemacs/init= is triggered at the very beginning of =Spacemacs=
    loading.
  - =dotspacemacs/config= is triggered at the very end of =Spacemacs= loading.

*** Custom variables
Custom variables configuration from =M-x customize-group= which are
automatically saved by Emacs are stored at the end of your =~/.spacemacs= file.

* Main principles
** Evil
=Spacemacs= uses the [[https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home][evil]] mode package to emulate Vim key bindings. It is a very
complete emulation, maybe the most advanced. In fact, Evil is much more than
just a Vim emulation. It has more states than Vim for instance.

** Holy
Thanks to the new holy-mode Spacemacs can now be used by Vim users or Emacs
users by setting the =dotspacemacs-editing-style= variable to ='vim= or ='emacs=
in the dotfile. In Emacs style the leader is available as ~M-m~. It is possible
to dynamically switch between evil and holy modes using ~SPC P tab~.

*** States
=Spacemacs= has 9 states:

| normal       | orange      | like the =normal mode of Vim=, used to execute and combine commands                                        |
| insert       | green       | like the =insert mode of Vim=, used to actually insert text                                                |

| emacs        | blue        | exclusive to =Evil=, using this state is like using a regular Emacs without Vim                            |

Note: Technically speaking there are also the =operator= and =replace= evil
states.

** Evil leader
=Spacemacs= heavily uses the [[https://github.com/cofi/evil-leader][evil-leader]] mode which brings the Vim leader key to
the Emacs world.

This leader key is commonly set to ~,~ by Vim users, in =Spacemacs= the leader
key is set on ~SPC~ (space bar, hence the name =spacemacs=). This key is the
most accessible key on a keyboard and it is pressed with the thumb which is a
good choice to lower the risk of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury][RSI]].

So with =Spacemacs= there is no need to remap your keyboard modifiers to attempt
to reduce the risk of RSI, every command can be executed very easily while you
are in =normal= mode by pressing the ~SPC~ leader key, here are a few examples:

-  Save a buffer: ~SPC f s~
-  Save all opened buffers: ~SPC f S~
-  Open (switch) to a buffer with =helm=: ~SPC b b~

** Universal argument
The universal argument ~C-u~ is an important command in Emacs but it is also a
very handy Vim key binding to scroll up.

=Spacemacs= binds ~C-u~ to =scroll-up= and change the universal argument binding
to ~SPC u~.

** Micro-states
=Spacemacs= defines a wide variety of =micro-states= (temporary overlay maps)
where it makes sense. This prevents one from doing repetitive and tedious
presses on the ~SPC~ key.

When a =micro-state= is active, a documentation is displayed in the minibuffer.
Additional information may as well be displayed in the minibuffer.

[[#auto-highlight-and-edition-of-symbols][Auto-highlight-symbol micro-state]]:
[[file:img/spacemacs-ahs-micro-state.png]]

[[#text][Text scale micro-state]]:
[[file:img/spacemacs-scale-micro-state.png]]

* Differences between Vim, Evil and Spacemacs
- The ~,~ key does "repeat last ~f~, ~t~, ~F~, or ~T~ command in
  opposite direction in =Vim=, but in =Spacemacs= it is the major mode specific
  leader key by default (which can be set on another key binding in the
  dotfile).

Send a PR to add the differences you found in this section.

** The vim-surround case
There is one obvious visible difference though. It is not between =Evil= and
=Vim= but between =Spacemacs= and [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround][vim-surround]]: the =surround= command is on ~S~
in =vim-surround= whereas it is on ~s~ in =Spacemacs=.

This is something that can surprise some Vim users so let me explain why this is
the case:
  - ~s~ and ~c~ do the same thing in =visual state=,
  - ~s~ is only useful to delete /one/ character and add more than one character
    which is a /very/ narrow use case
  - ~c~ accept motions and can do everything ~s~ can do in =normal state=
    - this is also true for ~r~ but ~r~ is more useful because it stays in =normal state=
  - =surround= command is just a more powerful command than ~s~.

If you are not convinced, then here is the snippet to revert back to the default
=Vim + vim-surround= setup (add it to your =dotspacemacs/config= function or
your =~/.spacemacs=):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (evil-define-key 'visual evil-surround-mode-map "s" 'evil-substitute)
    (evil-define-key 'visual evil-surround-mode-map "S" 'evil-surround-region)
#+end_src

* Evil plugins
=Spacemacs= ships with the following evil plugins:

                 | Mode                          | Description                                              |

* Spacemacs UI
=Spacemacs= has unique UI elements to make the Emacs experience even more
enjoyable:
  - dedicated startup page with a mode aimed at easily managing =Spacemacs=
  - dedicated helm source via =helm-spacemacs=
  - a [[https://github.com/kai2nenobu/guide-key][guide-key]] buffer

** Graphical UI
=Spacemacs= has a minimalistic and distraction free graphical UI:
  - custom [[https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline][powerline]] mode-line [[#flycheck-integration][with color feedback]] according to current [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][Flycheck]] status
  - unicode symbols for minor mode lighters which appear in the mode-line
  - [[#errors-handling][custom fringe bitmaps]] and error feedbacks for [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][Flycheck]]

*** Color themes
By default, =Spacemacs= uses the theme [[https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs][solarized-light]].

It is possible to define your default themes in your =~/.spacemacs= with the
variable =dotspacemacs-themes=. For instance, to specify =leuven= and =zenburn=
(high contrast theme and low contrast theme):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq-default dotspacemacs-themes '(leuven zenburn))
#+end_src

| Key Binding | Description                                           |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC T n~   | switch to next theme listed in =dotspacemacs-themes=. |
| ~SPC T h~   | select a theme using a =helm= buffer.                 |

*Note:*
  - You don't need to explicitly list in a layer the theme packages you are
    defining in =dotspacemacs-themes=, Spacemacs is smart enough to remove those
    packages from the list of orphans.
  - Due to the inner working of themes in Emacs, switching theme during the same
    session may have some weird side effects. Although these side effects should
    be pretty rare.

*Hint* If you are an =Org= user, [[https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme][leuven-theme]] is amazing ;-)

*** Font
The default font used by =Spacemacs= is [[https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro][source code pro]] by Adobe. It is
recommended to install it on your system.

To change the default font set the variable =dotspacemacs-default-font= in your
=.spacemacs= file.

By default its value is:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq-default dotspacemacs-default-font '("Source Code Pro"
                                              :size 13
                                              :weight normal
                                              :width normal
                                              :powerline-scale 1.1))
#+end_src

The properties should be pretty straightforward, it is possible to set any valid
property of a [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Low_002dLevel-Font.html][font-spec]]:
  - =:family= Font family or fontset (a string).
  - =:width= Relative character width. This should be one of the symbols:
    - ultra-condensed
    - extra-condensed
    - condensed
    - semi-condensed
    - normal
    - semi-expanded
    - expanded
    - extra-expanded
    - ultra-expanded
  - =:height= The height of the font. In the simplest case, this is an integer
    in units of 1/10 point.
  - =:weight= Font weight- one of the symbols (from densest to faintest):
    - ultra-bold
    - extra-bold
    - bold
    - semi-bold
    - normal
    - semi-light
    - light
    - extra-light
    - ultra-light
  - =:slant= Font slant- one of the symbols:
    - italic
    - oblique
    - normal
    - reverse-italic
    - reverse-oblique
  - =:size= The font size- either a non-negative integer that specifies the
    pixel size, or a floating-point number that specifies the point size.
  - =:adstyle= Additional typographic style information for the font, such as
    'sans'. The value should be a string or a symbol.
  - =:registry= The charset registry and encoding of the font, such as
    'iso8859-1'. The value should be a string or a symbol.
  - =:script= The script that the font must support (a symbol).

The special property =:powerline-scale= is =Spacemacs= specific and it is for
quick tweaking of the mode-line height in order to avoid crappy rendering of the
separators like on the following screenshot (default value is 1.1).

/Ugly separators/

*** Graphical UI Toggles
Some graphical UI indicators can be toggled on and off (toggles start with ~t~
and ~T~):

| Key Binding | Description                                                       |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC t~~    | display =~= in the fringe on empty lines                          |
| ~SPC t f~   | display the fill column (by default the fill column is set to 80) |
| ~SPC t h h~ | toggle highlight of the current line                              |
| ~SPC t h i~ | toggle highlight indentation levels                               |
| ~SPC t h c~ | toggle highlight indentation current column                       |
| ~SPC t i~   | toggle indentation guide at point                                 |
| ~SPC t l~   | toggle truncate lines                                             |
| ~SPC t L~   | toggle visual lines                                               |
| ~SPC t n~   | show the absolute line numbers                                    |

    | Key Binding | Description                  |
    |-------------+------------------------------|
    | ~SPC T F~   | toggle frame fullscreen      |
    | ~SPC T f~   | toggle display of the fringe |
    | ~SPC T m~   | toggle menu bar              |
    | ~SPC T M~   | toggle frame maximize        |
    | ~SPC T t~   | toggle tool bar              |
    | ~SPC T T~   | toggle frame transparency    |

*Note* These toggles are all available via the =helm-spacemacs= interface (press
~SPC f e h~ to display the =helm-spacemacs= buffer).

*** Mouse usage
There are some added mouse features set for the line number margin (if shown):

-  single click in line number margin visually selects the entire line
-  drag across line number margin visually selects the region
-  double click in line number margin visually select the current code block

*** Mode-line
The mode line is a heavily customized [[https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline][powerline]] with the following capabilities:
  - show the window number
  - color code for current state
  - show the number of search occurrences via anzu
  - toggle flycheck info
  - toggle battery info
  - toggle minor mode lighters

Reminder of the color codes for the states:

| Evil State           | Color    |
|----------------------+----------|
| Normal               | Orange   |
| Insert               | Green    |
| Visual               | Grey     |
| Emacs                | Blue     |
| Motion               | Purple   |
| Lisp                 | Pink     |
| Iedit/Iedit-Insert   | Red      |

Some elements can be dynamically toggled:

| Key Binding | Description                                                     |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC t m b~ | toggle the battery status                                       |
| ~SPC t m c~ | toggle the =org= task clock (available in =org= layer)          |
| ~SPC t m f~ | toggle the flycheck info (available in =syntax-checking= layer) |
| ~SPC t m m~ | toggle the minor mode lighters                                  |
| ~SPC t m n~ | toggle the cat! (if =colors= layer is declared in your dotfile) |
| ~SPC t m p~ | toggle the point character position                             |
| ~SPC t m t~ | toggle the mode line itself                                     |
| ~SPC t m v~ | toggle the new version lighter                                  |

**** Powerline font installation for terminal-mode users
Users who run Emacs in terminal mode may need to install the [[https://github.com/powerline/fonts][Powerline patched
fonts]] and configure their terminal clients to use them to make the Powerline
separators render correctly.

**** Flycheck integration
When [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][Flycheck]] minor mode is enabled, a new element appears showing the number of
errors, warnings and info.

#+CAPTION: powerline-wave

[[file:img/powerline-wave.png]]

**** Anzu integration
[[https://github.com/syohex/emacs-anzu][Anzu]] shows the number of occurrence when performing a search. =Spacemacs=
integrates nicely the Anzu status by displaying it temporarily when ~n~ or ~N~
are being pressed. See the =5/6= segment on the screenshot below.

#+CAPTION: powerline-anzu

[[file:img/powerline-anzu.png]]

**** Battery status integration
[[https://github.com/lunaryorn/fancy-battery.el][fancy-battery]] displays the percentage of total charge of the battery as well as
the time remaining to charge or discharge completely the battery.

A color code is used for the battery status:

| Battery State   | Color    |
|-----------------+----------|
| Charging        | Green    |
| Discharging     | Orange   |
| Critical        | Red      |

Note the these colors may vary depending on your theme.

**** Powerline separators
It is possible to easily customize the =powerline separator= by setting the
=powerline-default-separator= variable in your =~./spacemacs=. For instance if
you want to set back the separator to the well-known =arrow= separator add the
following snippet to your configuration file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun dotspacemacs/config ()
    "This is were you can ultimately override default Spacemacs configuration.
  This function is called at the very end of Spacemacs initialization."
    (setq powerline-default-separator 'arrow))
#+end_src

To save you the time to try all the possible separators provided by the
powerline, here is an exhaustive set of screenshots:

| Separator    | Screenshot                        |
|--------------+-----------------------------------|
| =alternate=  | [[file:img/powerline-alternate.png]]  |
| =arrow=      | [[file:img/powerline-arrow.png]]      |
| =arrow-fade= | [[file:img/powerline-arrow-fade.png]] |
| =bar=        | [[file:img/powerline-bar.png]]        |
| =box=        | [[file:img/powerline-box.png]]        |
| =brace=      | [[file:img/powerline-brace.png]]      |
| =butt=       | [[file:img/powerline-butt.png]]       |

| =roundstub=  | [[file:img/powerline-roundstub.png]]  |
| =slant=      | [[file:img/powerline-slant.png]]      |
| =wave=       | [[file:img/powerline-wave.png]]       |
| =zigzag=     | [[file:img/powerline-zigzag.png]]     |
| =nil=        | [[file:img/powerline-nil.png]]        |

**** Minor Modes
=Spacemacs= uses [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiminishedModes][diminish]] mode to reduce the size of minor mode indicators:

The minor mode area can be toggled on and off with ~SPC t m m~

Unicode symbols are displayed by default. Setting the variable
=dotspacemacs-mode-line-unicode-symbols= to =nil= in your =~/.spacemacs= will
display ASCII characters instead (may be useful in terminal if you cannot set an
appropriate font).

The letters displayed in the mode-line correspond to the key bindings used to
toggle them.

Some toggle have two flavors: local and global. The global version of the toggle
can be reached using the =control= key.

| Key Binding | Unicode | ASCII | Mode                                |
|-------------+---------+-------+-------------------------------------|
| ~SPC t -~   | =⊝=     | -     | [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/centered-cursor-mode.el][centered-cursor]]  mode               |

* Commands
** Vim key bindings
=Spacemacs= is based on =Vim= modal user interface to navigate and edit text. If
you are not familiar with the =Vim= way of editing text you can try the
[[https://github.com/syl20bnr/evil-tutor][evil-tutor]] lessons by pressing ~SPC h T~ at any time.

*** Escaping
=Spacemacs= uses [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/evil-escape][evil-escape]] to easily switch between =insert state= and =normal
state= by quickly pressing the ~fd~ keys.

The choice of ~fd~ was made to be able to use the same sequence to escape from
"everything" in Emacs:
  - escape from all evil states to normal state
  - escape from evil-lisp-state to normal state
  - abort evil ex command
  - quit minibuffer
  - abort isearch
  - quit magit buffers
  - quit help buffers
  - quit apropos buffers
  - quit ert buffers
  - quit undo-tree buffer
  - quit paradox
  - quit gist-list menu
  - hide neotree buffer

If you find yourself in a buffer where the =Spacemacs= (~SPC~) or Vim
keybindings don't work you can use this to get back to =normal state= (for
example in ~SPC : customize~ press ~fd~ to make ~SPC b b~ work again).

This sequence can be customized in your =~/.spacemacs=. Example to set it to
~jj~ (it is important set the variable in =dotspacemacs/init=):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun dotspacemacs/init ()
    (setq-default evil-escape-key-sequence "jj"))
#+end_src

*Note:* Although ~jj~ or ~jk~ are popular choices of vim users, these key
sequences are not optimal for =Spacemacs=. Indeed it is very easy in =visual
state= to press quickly ~jj~ and inadvertently escape to =normal state=.

*Important Note* One caveat of =evil-escape= is that you must not use it while
recording macros. Use =escape= key instead.

*** Executing Vim and Emacs ex/M-x commands
    | Command          | Key Binding |
    |------------------+-------------|
    | Vim (ex-command) | ~:~         |
    | Emacs (M-x)      | ~SPC :~     |

The command key ~:~ can be easily changed with the variable
=dotspacemacs-command-key= of your =~/.spacemacs=. Note that is will change both
~:~ and ~SPC :~ bindings to keep the symmetry between Vim and Emacs. A good key
can be ~,~ for example.

*** Leader key
On top of =Vim= modes (modes are called states in =Spacemacs=) there is a
special key called the leader key which once pressed gives a whole new keyboard
layer. The leader key is by default ~SPC~ (space). It is possible to change this
key with the variable =dotspacemacs-leader-key=.

** Reserved prefix command for user
~SPC o~ is reserved for the user. Setting key bindings behind ~SPC o~ is
*guaranteed* to never conflict with =Spacemacs= defaults key bindings.

*Example:* Put =(evil-leader/set-key "oc" 'org-capture)= inside
=dotspacemacs/config= in your =~/.spacemacs= file, to be able to use ~SPC o c~
to run org mode capture.

** Helm
=Spacemacs= is powered by [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] which is an incremental completion and selection
narrowing framework.

=Helm= is the central control tower of =Spacemacs=, it is used to manage
buffers, projects, search results, configuration layers, toggles and more...

Mastering =Helm= will make you a =Spacemacs= power user. Do not hesitate to read
the [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki][Helm documentation wiki]].

*** C-z and Tab switch
The command bound to ~C-z~ is much more useful than the one bound to Tab, so it
makes sense to swap them. It's also recommended [[http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html][here]].

*** Helm micro-state
=Spacemacs= defines a [[#micro-states][micro-state]] for =Helm= to make it work like [[https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim][Vim's Unite]]
plugin.

Initiate the micro-state with ~M-SPC~ or ~s-M-SPC~ while in a =Helm= buffer.

| Key Binding          | Description                                      |
|----------------------+--------------------------------------------------|
| ~M-SPC~ or ~s-M-SPC~ | initiate or leave the micro-state                |
| ~TAB~                | switch to actions page and leave the micro-state |
| ~1~                  | execute action 0                                 |

| ~l~                  | go to next source                                |
| ~q~                  | quit micro-state                                 |
| ~t~                  | mark current candidate                           |
| ~T~                  | mark all candidates                              |
| ~v~                  | execute persistent action                        |

** Discovering
*** Key bindings
**** Guide-key
An help buffer is displayed each time the ~SPC~ key is pressed in normal mode.
It lists the available key bindings and their associated commands.

By default the [[https://github.com/kai2nenobu/guide-key][guide-key]] buffer will be displayed quickly after the key has been
pressed. You can change the delay by setting the variable
=dotspacemacs-guide-key-delay= to your liking (the value is in second).

**** Helm describe key bindings
It is possible to search for specific key bindings by pressing ~SPC ?~.

To narrow the list to some key bindings using the leader key type a pattern like
this regular expression: ~SPC\ b~ which would list all =buffer= related
bindings.

*** Getting help
=Describe functions= are powerful Emacs introspection commands to get
information about functions, variables, modes etc. These commands are bound
thusly:

| Key Binding | Description                            |
|-------------+----------------------------------------|
| ~SPC h d b~ | describe bindings in a =helm= buffer   |
| ~SPC h d c~ | describe current character under point |
| ~SPC h d f~ | describe a function                    |
| ~SPC h d k~ | describe a key                         |
| ~SPC h d m~ | describe current modes                 |
| ~SPC h d p~ | describe a package                     |
| ~SPC h d t~ | describe a theme                       |
| ~SPC h d v~ | describe a variable                    |

Other help key bindings:

| Key Binding | Description                                   |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC h i~   | search in info pages with the symbol at point |
| ~SPC h m~   | search available man pages                    |

*** Available layers
All layers can be easily discovered via =helm-spacemacs= accessible with ~SPC f
e h~.

The following helm actions are available:
  - default: open the layer =README.md=
  - 2nd: open the layer =packages.el=
  - 3nd: open the layer =extensions.el=

**** Available packages in Spacemacs
=helm-spacemacs= also lists all the packages available in =Spacemacs=. The entry
format is =(layer) packages=. If you type =flycheck= you'll be able to see all
the layers where =flycheck= is used.

The following helm actions are available on packages:
  - default: go the package init function

**** New packages from ELPA repositories
=package-list-packages= is where you can browse for all available packages in
the different Elpa repositories. It is possible to upgrade packages from there
but it is not recommended, use the =[Update]= link on the =Spacemacs= startup
page instead.

=Spacemacs= proposes to use [[https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/paradox][Paradox]] instead of =package-list-packages= to list
available ELPA packages. Paradox enhances the package list buffer with better
feedbacks, new filters and Github information like the number of stars.
Optionally you can also star packages directly in the buffer.

*Important Note 1* Installing a new package from =Paradox= won't make it
persistent. To install a package persistently you have to add it explicitly to a
configuration layer.

*Important Note 2* Don't /update/ your packages from =Paradox= or
=package-list-packages= because they don't support the rollback feature of
Spacemacs.

| Key Binding | Description                                           |

| ~x~         | execute (action flags)                                |

*** Toggles
=helm-spacemacs= is also a central place to discover the available toggles. To
display only the toggles source press ~C-l~ (or in [[#helm-micro-state][Helm micro-state]] you can
press just ~l~).

The following helm actions are available on packages:
  - default: toggle on/off

*Tips* Use ~SPC h l~ to resume the last helm session. It is handy to quickly
toggle on and off a toggle.

** Navigating
*** Point/Cursor
Navigation is performed using the Vi key bindings ~hjkl~.

| Key Binding | Description                                                                       |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~h~         | move cursor left                                                                  |
| ~j~         | move cursor down                                                                  |
| ~k~         | move cursor up                                                                    |
| ~l~         | move cursor right                                                                 |
| ~H~         | move quickly up (10 lines at a time)                                              |
| ~L~         | move quickly down (10 lines at a time)                                            |
| ~SPC j h~   | go to the beginning of line (and set a mark at the previous location in the line) |
| ~SPC j l~   | go to the end of line (and set a mark at the previous location in the line)       |
| ~SPC t -~   | lock the cursor at the center of the screen                                       |

**** Smooth scrolling
[[https://github.com/aspiers/smooth-scrolling][smooth-scrolling]] prevent the point to jump when it reaches the top or
bottom of the screen. It is enabled by default.

On Windows, you may want to disable it. To disable the smooth scrolling set the
=dotspacemacs-smooth-scrolling= variable in your =~/.spacemacs= to =nil=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq-default dotspacemacs-smooth-scrolling t)
#+end_src

*** Vim motions with ace-jump mode
=Spacemacs= uses the =evil= integration of [[https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode][ace-jump mode]] which enables the
invocation of =ace-jump-mode= during motions.

It is useful for deleting visually a set of lines, try the following sequence in
a buffer containing some text: ~d SPC l~

| Key Binding | Description                                        |
|-------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC SPC~   | initiate ace jump word mode                        |
| ~SPC l~     | initiate ace jump line mode                        |
| ~SPC `~     | go back to the previous location (before the jump) |

Hint: you may change to char mode by ~C-c C-c~ in word mode.

**** ace-link mode
Similar to =ace-jump-mode=, [[https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-link][ace-link]] allows one to jump to any link in
=help-mode= and =info-mode= with two key strokes.

| Key Binding | Description                                           |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| ~o~         | initiate ace link mode in =help-mode= and =info-mode= |

*** Window manipulation
**** Window manipulation key bindings
Every window has a number displayed at the start of the mode-line and
can be quickly accessed using =SPC number=.

| Key Binding | Description           |
|-------------+-----------------------|
| ~SPC 1~     | go to window number 1 |
| ~SPC 2~     | go to window number 2 |
| ~SPC 3~     | go to window number 3 |
| ~SPC 4~     | go to window number 4 |
| ~SPC 5~     | go to window number 5 |
| ~SPC 6~     | go to window number 6 |
| ~SPC 7~     | go to window number 7 |
| ~SPC 8~     | go to window number 8 |
| ~SPC 9~     | go to window number 9 |
| ~SPC 0~     | go to window number 0 |

Windows manipulation commands (start with ~w~):

**** Golden ratio
If you resize windows like crazy you may want to give a try to [[https://github.com/roman/golden-ratio.el][golden-ratio]].

=golden-ratio= resizes windows dynamically depending on whether they are
selected or not. By default =golden-ratio= is off.

The mode can be toggled on and off with ~SPC t g~.

*** Buffers and Files
Since =helm= is used everywhere, by default Spacemacs uses =helm= to open files.

Some users prefer the =ido= way to navigate the file system because it can
remember the last selected directories and buffers and ~RET~ is used to open
directories instead of ~TAB~ or ~C-z~ in =helm=. It is possible to use =ido=
instead of =helm= by setting the variable =dotspacemacs-use-ido= to =t= in your
dotfile.

**** Buffers manipulation key bindings
Buffer manipulation commands (start with ~b~):

| Key Binding | Description                                                             |

| ~SPC b C-K~ | kill all buffers matching the regexp                                    |
| ~SPC b m h~ | move a buffer to the left                                               |

| ~SPC b M~   | swap windows using [[https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-window][ace-swap-window]]                                      |
| ~SPC b n~   | switch to next buffer avoiding special buffers                          |

**** Buffers manipulation manipulation micro-state
A convenient buffer manipulation micro-state allows to quickly cycles through
the opened buffer and kill them.

| Key Binding   | Description                                   |
|---------------+-----------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC b .~     | initiate micro-state                          |
| ~K~           | kill current buffer                           |
| ~n~           | go to next buffer (avoid special buffers)     |
| ~N~           | go to previous buffer (avoid special buffers) |
| Any other key | leave the micro-state                         |

**** Special Buffers
Unlike vim, emacs creates many buffers that most people do not need to see. Some
examples are =*Messages*= and =*Compile-Log*=. Spacemacs tries to automatically
ignore buffers that are not useful. However, you may want to change the way
Spacemacs marks buffers as useful. For instructions, see the [[./HOWTOs.org#change-special-buffer-rules][special buffer
howto]].

**** Files manipulations key bindings
Files manipulation commands (start with ~f~):

| Key Binding | Description                                                    |
|-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|

| ~SPC f e d~ | open the spacemacs dotfile (=~/.spacemacs=)                          |
| ~SPC f e D~ | open =ediff= buffer of =~/.spacemacs= and =.spacemacs.template=      |
| ~SPC f e h~ | discover =Spacemacs= documentation, layers and packages using =helm= |
| ~SPC f e i~ | open the all mighty =init.el=                                        |

*** Ido
=Spacemacs= displays the =ido= minibuffer vertically thanks to the
[[https://github.com/gempesaw/ido-vertical-mode.el][ido-vertical-mode]].

Basic =ido= operations can be done with ~Ctrl~ key:

| Key Binding        | Description                                       |

| ~C-S-l~            | go to next directory                              |

*** Ido micro-state
=Spacemacs= defines a [[#micro-states][micro-state]] for =ido=.

Initiate the micro-state with ~M-SPC~ or ~s-M-SPC~ while in an =ido= buffer.

| Key Binding          | Description                         |

*** NeoTree file tree
=Spacemacs= provides a quick and simple way to navigate in an unknown project
file tree with [[https://github.com/jaypei/emacs-neotree][NeoTree]].

To toggle the =NeoTree= buffer press ~SPC f t~ or ~SPC p t~ (the latter open
NeoTree with the root set to the projectile project root).

The NeoTree window always has the number =0= so it does not shift the current
number of the other windows. To select the NeoTree window you then use ~SPC 0~.

**** NeoTree navigation
Navigation is centered on the ~hjkl~ with the hope to provide a fast navigation
experience like in [[http://ranger.nongnu.org/][ranger]]:

*Note:* The point is automatically set to the first letter of a node for a
smoother experience.

**** Opening files with NeoTree
By default a file is opened in the last active window. It is possible to choose
window number where to open a file by using a numeric argument, for instance ~2
l~ or ~2 RET~ will open the current file in window 2. It is also possible to
open the file in a split window with ~|~ and ~-~:

| Key Binding      | Description                               |
|------------------+-------------------------------------------|
| ~l~ or ~RET~     | open file in last active window           |
| ~# l~ or ~# RET~ | open file in window number =#=            |
| ~¦~              | open file in an vertically split window   |
| ~-~              | open file in an horizontally split window |

**** Other NeoTree key bindings
| Key Binding | Description                     |
|-------------+---------------------------------|
| ~TAB~       | toggle stretching of the buffer |
| ~c~         | create a node                   |
| ~d~         | delete a node                   |
| ~g~         | refresh                         |
| ~s~         | toggle showing of hidden files  |
| ~q~ or ~fd~ | hide =NeoTree= buffer           |
| ~r~         | rename a node                   |

**** NeoTree mode-line
The mode-line has the following format =[x/y] d (D:a, F:b)= where:
  - =x= is the index of the current selected file or directory
  - =y= the total number of items (file and directory) in the current directory
  - =d= the name of the current directory
  - =a= the number of directories in the current directory
  - =b= the number of files in the current directory

*** Bookmarks
Bookmarks can be set anywhere in a file. Bookmarks are persistent. They are very
useful to jump to/open a known project. =Spacemacs= uses =helm-bookmarks= to
manage them.

Open an =helm= window with the current bookmarks by pressing: ~SPC h b~

Then in the =helm-bookmarks= buffer:

| Key Binding | Description                                  |

| ~C-f~       | toggle filename location                     |
| ~C-o~       | open the selected bookmark in another window |

To save a new bookmark, just type the name of the bookmark and press ~RET~.

*** DocView mode
=doc-view-mode= is a built-in major mode to view DVI, PostScript (PS), PDF,
OpenDocument, and Microsoft Office documents.

** Auto-saving
*** Frequency of auto-saving
By default auto-saving of files is performed every 300 characters and
every 30 seconds of idle time which can be changed by setting to a
new value the variables =auto-save-inteval= and =auto-save-timeout=
respectively.

*** Location of auto-saved files
Auto-save of modified files can be performed in-place on the original file
itself /or/ in the cache directory (in this case the original file will remain
unsaved). By default Spacemacs auto-save the file in the cache directory.

To modify the location set the variable =dotspacemacs-auto-save-file-location=
to =original= or =cache=.

Local files are auto-saved in a sub-directory called =site= in the =cache=
directory whereas remote files (i.e. files edited over TRAMP) are auto-saved
in a sub-directory called =dist=.

*** Disable auto-save
To disable auto-saving set the variable =dotspacemacs-auto-save-file-location=
to =nil=.

You can toggle auto-save in a buffer by calling the command =auto-save-mode=.

** Searching
*** With an external tool
=Spacemacs= can be interfaced with different search utilities like:
  - ack
  - grep
  - [[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher][ag]]
  - [[https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher][pt]]

The search commands in Spacemacs are organized under the ~SPC s~ prefix with
the next key is the tool to use and the last key is the scope. For instance
~SPC s a b~ will search in all opened buffers using =ag=.
If the last key (determining the scope) is uppercase then the current region
or symbol under point is used as default input for the search. For instance
~SPC s a B~ will search with symbol under point (if there is no active region).
If the tool key is omitted then a default tool will be automatically
selected for the search. This tool corresponds to the first tool found on the
system of the list =dotspacemacs-search-tools=, the default order is =ag=,
=pt=, =ack= then =grep=. For instance ~SPC b b~ will search in the opened
buffers using =pt= if =ag= has not been found on the system.

The tool keys are:

| Tool | Key |
|------+-----|
| ag   | a   |
| grep | g   |
| ack  | k   |
| pt   | t   |

The available scopes and corresponding keys are:

| Scope                      | Key    |
|----------------------------+--------|
| opened buffers             | b      |
| files in a given directory | f      |
| current project            | p      |

It is possible to search in the current file by double tapping the second key
of the sequence, for instance ~SPC s a a~ will search in the current
file with =ag=.

*Notes*
- =ag= and =pt= are optimized to be used in a source control repository but
  they can be used in an arbitrary directory as well.
- It is also possible to search in several directories at once by marking
  them in the helm buffer.

*Beware* if you use =pt=, [[https://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/doc/trunk/embedded/www/tcllib/files/apps/pt.html][TCL parser tools]] also install a command line tool
called =pt=.

*** Persistent highlighting
=Spacemacs= uses =evil-search-highlight-persist= to keep the searched expression
highlighted until the next search. It is also possible to clear the highlighting
by pressing ~SPC s c~ or executing the ex command =:noh=.

*** Stacking highlights
With [[https://github.com/boyw165/hl-anything][hl-anything]] it is possible to
highlight all occurrences of the word under point. The highlights can be
stacked.

| Key Binding | Description                                                                 |

*** Highlight current symbol
=Spacemacs= supports highlighting of the current symbol on demand (provided by
the [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/auto-highlight-symbol][auto-highlight-symbol]] mode) and adds a micro-state to easily navigate and
rename this symbol.

It is also possible to change the range of the navigation on the fly to:
  - buffer
  - function
  - visible area

To initiate the highlighting of the current symbol under point press ~SPC s h~.

Navigation between the highlighted symbols can be done with the commands:

| Key Binding | Description                                                                  |
|-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~/~         | initiate navigation micro-state on current symbol and jump forwards          |
| ~#~         | initiate navigation micro-state on current symbol and jump backwards         |
| ~SPC s e~   | edit all occurrences of the current symbol(/)                                |
| ~SPC s h~   | highlight the current symbol and all its occurrence within the current range |
| ~SPC s H~   | go to the last searched occurrence of the last highlighted symbol            |
| ~SPC s R~   | change range to default (=whole buffer=)                                     |

In 'Spacemacs' highlight symbol micro-state:

| Key Binding   | Description                                                   |
|---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~e~           | edit occurrences (*)                                          |
| ~n~           | go to next occurrence                                         |
| ~N~           | go to previous occurrence                                     |
| ~d~           | go to next definition occurrence                              |
| ~D~           | go to previous definition occurrence                          |
| ~r~           | change range (=function=, =display area=, =whole buffer=)     |
| ~R~           | go to home occurrence (reset position to starting occurrence) |
| Any other key | leave the navigation micro-state                              |

(*) using [[https://github.com/tsdh/iedit][iedit]] or the default implementation
of =auto-highlight-symbol=

The micro-state text in minibuffer display the following information:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <M> [6/11]* press (n/N) to navigate, (e) to edit, (r) to change range or (R)
    for reset
#+END_EXAMPLE

Where =<M> [x/y]*= is:
  - M: the current range mode
  - =<B>=: whole buffer range
  - =<D>=: current display range
  - =<F>=: current function range
  - =x=: the index of the current highlighted occurrence
  - =y=: the total number of occurrences
  - =*=: appears if there is at least one occurrence which is not currently visible.

*** Visual Star
With [[https://github.com/bling/evil-visualstar][evil-visualstar]] you can search for the next occurrence of the current
selection.

It is pretty useful combined with the [[#region-selection][expand-region]] bindings.

/Note:/ If the current state is not the =visual state= then pressing ~*~ uses
[[#auto-highlight-symbols][auto-highlight-symbol]] and its micro-state.

*** Listing symbols by semantic
Use =helm-semantic-or-imenu= command from =Helm= to quickly navigate between the
symbols in a buffer.

To list all the symbols of a buffer press: ~SPC s l~

*** Helm-swoop
This is very similar to =moccur=, it displays a =helm= buffer with all the
occurrences of the word under point. You can then change the search query in
real-time and navigate between them easily.

You can even edit the occurrences directly in the =helm= buffer and apply the
modifications to the buffer.

| Key Binding | Description                    |
|-------------+--------------------------------|
| ~SPC s s~   | execute =helm-swoop=           |
| ~SPC s S~   | execute =helm-multi-swoop=     |
| ~SPC s C-s~ | execute =helm-multi-swoop-all= |

** Editing
*** Paste text
**** Paste Micro-state
The paste micro-state can be enabled by settings the variable
=dotspacemacs-enable-paste-micro-state= to =t=. By default it is disabled.

When the micro-state is enabled, pressing ~p~ again will replace the pasted text
with the previous yanked (copied) text on the kill ring.

For example if you copy =foo= and =bar= then press ~p~ the text =bar= will
be pasted, pressing ~p~ again will replace =bar= with =foo=.

| Key Binding   | Description                                                               |
|---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~p~ or ~P~    | paste the text before or after point and initiate the =paste= micro-state |
| ~p~           | in micro-state: replace paste text with the previously copied one         |
| ~P~           | in micro-state: replace paste text with the next copied one               |
| ~.~           | paste the same text and leave the micro-state                             |
| Any other key | leave the micro-state                                                     |

**** Auto-indent pasted text
By default any pasted text will be auto-indented. To paste text un-indented use
the universal argument.

It is possible to disable the auto-indentation for specific major-modes by
adding a major-mode to the variable =spacemacs-indent-sensitive-modes= in your
=dotspacemacs/config= function.

*** Text manipulation commands
Text related commands (start with ~x~):

    | Key Binding | Description                                                   |
    |-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|

    | ~SPC x w C~ | count the number of occurrences per word in the select region |

*** Smartparens Strict mode
[[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][Smartparens]] comes with a strict mode which prevents deletion of parenthesis if
the result is unbalanced.

This mode can be frustrating for novices, this is why it is not enabled by
default.

It is possible to enable it easily for /all programming modes/ with the variable
=dotspacemacs-smartparens-strict-mode= of you =~/.spacemacs=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq-default dotspacemacs-smartparens-strict-mode t)
#+end_src

*** Zooming
**** Text
The font size of the current buffer can be adjusted with the commands:

| Key Binding     | Description                                                                  |
|-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC z x +~       | scale up the font and initiate the font scaling micro-state                  |
| ~SPC z x -~       | scale down the font and initiate the font scaling micro-state                |
| ~SPC z x =~       | reset the font size (no scaling) and initiate the font scaling micro-state   |
| ~+~               | increase the font size                                                       |
| ~-~               | decrease the font size                                                       |
| ~=~               | reset the font size                                                          |
| Any other key   | leave the font scaling micro-state                                           |

Note that /only/ the text of the current buffer is scaled, the other buffers,
the mode-line and the minibuffer are not affected. To zoom the whole content of
a frame use the =zoom frame= bindings (see next section).

**** Frame
You can zoom in and out the whole content of the frame with the commands:

| Key Binding     | Description                        |
|-----------------+------------------------------------|
| ~SPC z f +~       | zoom in the frame content          |
| ~SPC z f -~       | zoom out the frame content         |
| ~SPC z f =~       | reset the frame content size       |
| ~+~               | zoom in                            |
| ~-~               | zoom out                           |
| ~=~               | reset zoom                         |
| Any other key   | leave the zoom frame micro-state   |

*** Increase/Decrease numbers
=Spacemacs= uses [[https://github.com/cofi/evil-numbers][evil-numbers]] to easily increase or increase numbers.

| Key Binding | Description                                                     |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC n +~   | increase the number under point by one and initiate micro-state |
| ~SPC n -~   | decrease the number under point by one and initiate micro-state |

In micro-state:

| Key Binding     | Description                              |
|-----------------+------------------------------------------|
| ~+~               | increase the number under point by one   |
| ~-~               | decrease the number under point by one   |
| Any other key   | leave the micro-state                    |

*Tips:* you can increase or decrease a value by more that once by using a prefix
argument (ie. ~10 SPC n +~ will add 10 to the number under point).

*** Spell checking
Spell checking commands start with =S=:

    | Key Binding | Description                            |
    |-------------+----------------------------------------|
    | ~SPC S c~   | list of corrections in a =helm= buffer |
    | ~SPC S d~   | change dictionary language             |
    | ~SPC S n~   | go to the next spell check error       |

*** Region selection
Vi =Visual= modes are all supported by =evil=.

**** Expand-region
=Spacemacs= adds another =Visual= mode via the [[https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el][expand-region]] mode.

| Key Binding | Description                              |
|-------------+------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC v~     | initiate expand-region mode then...      |
| ~v~         | expand the region by one semantic unit   |
| ~V~         | contract the region by one semantic unit |
| ~r~         | reset the region to initial selection    |
| ~ESC~       | leave expand-region mode                 |

**** Indent text object
With [[https://github.com/cofi/evil-indent-textobject][evil-indent-textobject]] the following action can be performed in =normal
state=:
  - ~ii~ - Inner Indentation: the surrounding textblock with the same indentation
  - ~ai~ - Above and Indentation: ~ii~ + the line above with a different indentation
  - ~aI~ - Above and Indentation+: ~ai~ + the line below with a different indentation

Example (=|= is the point):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (while (not done) (messa|ge "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."))
      (1+ 41)
#+end_src

-  ~vii~ will select the line with message
-  ~vai~ will select the whole while loop
-  ~vaI~ will select the whole fragment

*** Region narrowing
The displayed text of a buffer can be narrowed with the commands (start with
~n~):

| Key Binding | Description                               |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC n f~   | narrow the buffer to the current function |
| ~SPC n p~   | narrow the buffer to the visible page     |
| ~SPC n r~   | narrow the buffer to the selected text    |
| ~SPC n w~   | widen, i.e show the whole buffer again    |

*** Line formatting
=Spacemacs= performs =go to the line below point and indent it= with ~SPC j k~.
You may repeat this operation with =evil-repeat= if you need to indent many
lines.

Line formatting commands start with ~j~:

   | Key Binding | Description                                              |
   |-------------+----------------------------------------------------------|
   | ~J~         | join the current line with the next line                 |
   | ~SPC j j~   | same as SPC j k but will split the current line at point |
   | ~SPC J~     | split a quoted string or s-expression in place           |
   | ~SPC j J~   | split a quoted string or s-expression and auto-indent    |
   | ~SPC j k~   | go to next line and indent it using auto-indent rules    |

Used together these key bindings are very powerful to quickly reformat code.

*** Replacing text with iedit
=Spacemacs= uses the powerful [[https://github.com/tsdh/iedit][iedit]] mode through [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/evil-iedit-state][evil-iedit-state]] to quickly
edit multiple occurrences of a symbol or selection.

=evil-iedit-state= defines two new evil states:
  - =iedit state=
  - =iedit-insert state=

The color code for these states is =red=.

=evil-iedit-state= has also a nice integration with [[https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el][expand-region]] for quick
edition of the current selected text by pressing ~e~.

**** iedit states key bindings
***** State transitions
| Key Binding | From             | To     |
|-------------+------------------+--------|
| ~SPC s e~   | normal or visual | iedit  |
| ~e~         | expand-region    | iedit  |
| ~ESC~       | iedit            | normal |
| ~C-g~       | iedit            | normal |
| ~fd~        | iedit            | normal |
| ~ESC~       | iedit-insert     | iedit  |
| ~C-g~       | iedit-insert     | normal |
| ~fd~        | iedit-insert     | normal |

To sum-up, in =iedit-insert state= you have to press ESC twice to go back to the
=normal state=. You can also at any time press ~C-g~ or ~fd~ to return to =normal
state=.

*Note:* evil commands which switch to =insert state= will switch in
=iedit-insert state=.

***** In iedit state
=iedit state= inherits from =normal state=, the following key bindings are
specific to =iedit state=.

| Key Binding | Description                                                                             |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~ESC~       | go back to =normal state=                                                               |
| ~TAB~       | toggle current occurrence                                                               |
| ~0~         | go to the beginning of the current occurrence                                           |
| ~$~         | go to the end of the current occurrence                                                 |
| ~#~         | prefix all occurrences with an increasing number (SPC u to choose the starting number). |
| ~A~         | go to the end of the current occurrence and switch to =iedit-insert state=              |
| ~D~         | delete the occurrences                                                                  |
| ~F~         | restrict the scope to the function                                                      |
| ~gg~        | go to first occurrence                                                                  |
| ~G~         | go to last occurrence                                                                   |
| ~I~         | go to the beginning of the current occurrence and switch to =iedit-insert state=        |
| ~J~         | increase the edition scope by one line below                                            |
| ~K~         | increase the edition scope by one line above                                            |
| ~L~         | restrict the scope to the current line                                                  |
| ~n~         | go to next occurrence                                                                   |
| ~N~         | go to previous occurrence                                                               |
| ~p~         | replace occurrences with last yanked (copied) text                                      |
| ~S~         | (substitute) delete the occurrences and switch to =iedit-insert state=                  |
| ~V~         | toggle visibility of lines with no occurrence                                           |
| ~U~         | Up-case the occurrences                                                                 |
| ~C-U~       | down-case the occurrences                                                               |

*Note:* ~0~, ~$~, ~A~ and ~I~ have the default Vim behavior when used outside of
an ~occurrence~.

***** In iedit-insert state
| Key Binding | Description               |
|-------------+---------------------------|
| ~ESC~       | go back to =iedit state=  |
| ~C-g~       | go back to =normal state= |

**** Examples
-  manual selection of several words then replace: ~v w w SPC s e S "toto" ESC ESC~
-  append text to a word on two lines: ~v i w SPC s e J i "toto" ESC ESC~
-  substitute symbol /with expand-region/: ~SPC v v e S "toto" ESC ESC~
-  replace symbol with yanked (copied) text /with expand region/: ~SPC v
   e p ESC ESC~

*** Replacing text in several files
Replacing an occurrence of text in several files can be performed via [[https://github.com/syohex/emacs-helm-ag][helm-ag]].

Say you want to replace all =foo= occurrences by =bar= in your current
project:
  - initiate a search with ~SPC /~
  - enter in edit mode with ~C-c C-e~
  - go to the occurrence and enter in =iedit state= with ~SPC s e~
  - edit the occurrences then leave the =iedit state=
  - press ~C-c C-c~

*Note* in Spacemacs, =helm-ag= despite its name works with =ack= and =pt= as
well.

*** Commenting
Comments are handled by [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/evil-nerd-commenter][evil-nerd-commenter]], it's bound to the following keys.

    | Key Binding | Description        |
    |-------------+--------------------|
    | ~SPC ;~     | comment operator   |
    | ~SPC c i~   | comment invert     |
    | ~SPC c l~   | comment lines      |
    | ~SPC c p~   | comment paragraphs |
    | ~SPC c r~   | comment region     |
    | ~SPC c t~   | comment to line    |
    | ~SPC c y~   | comment and yank   |

*Tips:* To comment efficiently a block of line use the combo ~SPC ; SPC l~

*** Deleting files
Deletion is configured to send deleted files to system trash.

On OS X the =trash= program is required. It can be installed with [[http:www.brew.sh][homebrew]] with
the following command:

#+begin_src sh
    $ brew install trash
#+end_src

To disable the trash you can set the variable =delete-by-moving-to-trash= to
=nil= in your =~/.spacemacs=.

*** Editing Lisp code
Edition of lisp code is provided by [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/evil-lisp-state][evil-lisp-state]].

Commands will set the current state to =lisp state= where different commands
combo can be repeated without pressing on ~SPC m~.

When in =lisp state= the color of the mode-line changes to pink.

Examples:
  - to slurp three times while in normal state: ~SPC k 3 n~
  - to wrap a symbol in parenthesis then slurping two times: ~SPC k w 2 n~

*Note* The =lisp state= commands are available in /any/ modes! Try it out.

**** Lisp Key Bindings
***** Lisp state key bindings
These commands automatically switch to =lisp state=.

| Key Binding | Function                                                            |

** Managing projects
Projects in =Spacemacs= are managed with [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]]. In =projectile= projects
are defined implicitly, for instance the root of a project is found when a
=.git= repository or =.projectile= file is encountered in the file tree.

=Helm= is used whenever it is possible.

To search in a project see [[#searching-in-a-project][project searching]].

=projectile= commands start with p:

    | Key Binding | Description                                           |

    | ~SPC s p p~ | run =pt=                                              |

** Registers
Access commands to the various registers start with =r=:

| Key Binding | Description                        |
|-------------+------------------------------------|
| ~SPC r e~   | show evil yank and named registers |
| ~SPC r m~   | show marks register                |
| ~SPC r r~   | show helm register                 |
| ~SPC r y~   | show kill ring                     |

** Errors handling
=Spacemacs= uses [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][Flycheck]] to gives error feedback on the fly. The checks are
only performed at save time by default.

Errors management commands (start with ~e~):

    | Key Binding | Description                                    |
    |-------------+------------------------------------------------|
    | ~SPC e c~   | clear all errors                               |
    | ~SPC e f~   | toggle flycheck                                |
    | ~SPC e l~   | display the =flycheck= list of errors/warnings |
    | ~SPC e n~   | go to the next error                           |
    | ~SPC e p~   | go to the previous error                       |

Custom fringe bitmaps:

| Symbol                   | Description |
|--------------------------+-------------|
| [[file:img/dot-error.png]]   | Error       |
| [[file:img/dot-warning.png]] | warning     |
| [[file:img/dot-info.png]]    | Info        |

** Compiling
=Spacemacs= binds a few commands to support compiling a project.

   | Key Binding | Description                    |
   |-------------+--------------------------------|
   | ~SPC c c~   | use =helm-make= via projectile |
   | ~SPC c C~   | compile                        |
   | ~SPC c r~   | recompile                      |

** Modes
*** Major Mode leader key
Key bindings specific to the current =major mode= start with ~SPC m~. For
convenience a shortcut key called the major mode leader key is set by default on
~,~ which saves one precious keystroke.

It is possible to change the major mode leader key by defining the variable
=dotspacemacs-major-mode-leader-key= in your =~/.spacemacs=. For example to
setup the key on tabulation:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq-default dotspacemacs-major-mode-leader-key "<tab>")
#+end_src

*** Helm
=Spacemacs= add =hjkl= navigation to =helm= buffers:

    | Key Binding | Description         |
    |-------------+---------------------|
    | ~C-h~       | go to previous page |
    | ~C-j~       | go to previous item |
    | ~C-k~       | go to next item     |
    | ~C-l~       | go to next page     |

** Emacs Server
=Spacemacs= starts a server at launch. This server is killed whenever you close
your Emacs windows.

*** Connecting to the Emacs server
You can open a file in Emacs from the terminal using =emacsclient=. Use
=emacsclient -c= to open the file in Emacs GUI. Use =emacsclient -t= to open the
file in Emacs within the terminal.

If you want your Linux/OS X system to use Emacs by default for any prompt, use
=export EDITOR="emacsclient -c"= in your shell configuration.

Note that if you're on OS X, you may have to refer to the emacsclient that comes
with your GUI Emacs, e.g. =export
EDITOR="/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient -c"=.

Tip: Remember to use ~:wq~ or ~C-x #~ after you are done editing the file in
Emacs.

See [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html][Emacs as a Server]] in the official Emacs manual for more details.

** Keeping the server alive
It is possible to keep the server alive when you close Emacs by setting the
variable =dotspacemacs-persistent-server= to =t= in your =~./spacemacs=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq-default dotspacemacs-persistent-server t)
#+end_src

When this variable is set to =t=, the only way to quit Emacs /and/ kill the
server is to use the following bindings:

| Keybinding | Description                                                        |
|------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC q q~  | Quit Emacs and kill the server, prompt for changed buffers to save |
| ~SPC q Q~  | Quit Emacs and kill the server, lose all unsaved changes.          |
| ~SPC q s~  | Save the buffers, quit Emacs and kill the server                   |
| ~SPC q z~  | Kill the current frame                                             |

** Troubleshoot
*** Loading fails
If any errors happen during the loading the mode-line will turn red and the
errors should appear inline in the startup buffer. Spacemacs should still be
usable, if it is not the case then restart Emacs with =emacs --debug-init= and
open a [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues][Github issue]] with the backtrace.

*** I have no file ~/.spacemacs
You have to manually copy the =~/.emacs.d/core/templates/.spacemacs.template=
file to =~/.spacemacs=
