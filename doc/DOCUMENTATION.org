* Core Pillars
Four core pillars: Mnemonic, Discoverable, Consistent and "Crowd-Configured".

If any of these core pillars is violated open an issue and we'll try our best
to fix it.

** Mnemonic
Key bindings are organized using mnemonic prefixes like ~b~ for buffer, ~p~ for
project, ~s~ for search, ~h~ for help etc...

** Discoverable
Innovative real-time display of available key bindings. Simple query
system to quickly find available layers, packages and more.

** Consistent
Similar functionalities have the same key binding everywhere thanks to a
clearly defined set of conventions. Documentation is mandatory for any layer
that ships with Spacemacs.

** Crowd-Configured
Community-driven configuration provides curated packages tuned by power users
and bugs are fixed quickly.

* Highlighted feature
- *Bring the efficiency of modal editing* to the powerful Emacs lisp platform.
  Modal UX is optional and Spacemacs can be used with only Emacs key bindings.

- Integrate nicely with =Evil= states (=Vim= modes).

- *Keep your fingers on the home row* for quicker editing with support for
  QWERTY and BEPO layouts.

- *Minimalistic and nice graphical UI*, keep your available screen space for
  what matters: your text files.

- *Fast boot time*, packages and configuration are lazy-loaded as much as
  possible.

- *Lower the risk of RSI* by heavily using the space bar instead of modifiers.
  If you have issues with your thumbs you can still use Spacemacs using
  modifiers.

- Contribute easily your improvements and new configuration layers.

- *Very active and helpful community* on =Gitter= and =IRC=
  (via Gitter IRC bridge)

* Screenshots

/Python/ [[file:img/spacemacs-python.png]]

*Note*: Even though screenshots are updated frequently, Spacemacs is evolving
quickly and the screenshots may not reflect exactly the current state of the
project.

* Who can benefit from this?
- Spacemacs was initially intended to be used by *Vim users* who want to go to
  the next level by using Emacs (see [[./VIMUSERS.org][guide]] for Vimmers). But it is now
  perfectly *usable by non Vim users* by choosing the =emacs= editing style.

- It is also a good fit for people wanting to *lower the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury][risk of RSI]]* induced by
  the default Emacs key bindings (this is an assumption, there are no official
  studies to prove this!). If you have issues using your thumbs you can still
  use the =emacs= editing style which puts the leader key on a modifier
  combination.

- Emacs users wanting to learn *a different way to edit files* or wanting to
  learn Vim key bindings or even wanting to mix both editing styles by setting
  their style to =hybrid=.

- Emacs users wanting a simple but deep configuration system that greatly
  *lower the risk of .emacs bankruptcy*.

* Update and Rollback
** Update Spacemacs repository
There are several methods of updating the core files and layer information for
Spacemacs. It is recommended to update the packages first, see the next section.

***  Automatic Updates
Spacemacs will automatically check for a new version every startup. When it
detects that a new version is available a arrow will appear in the modeline.
Click it to update Spacemacs. You must restart Emacs after updating.

Update Button:
[[file:img/powerline-update.png]]

*Note*: If you use the =develop= branch of Spacemacs, you must update using git.

*** Updating from the Spacemacs Buffer
Use the button labeled "Update Spacemacs" in the Spacemacs buffer. You will be
prompted for the version you would like to use.

*Note*: If you use the =develop= branch of Spacemacs, you cannot use this method.

*** Updating Manually with git

To update manually close Emacs and update the git repository:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ git pull --rebase
#+END_SRC


** Update packages
To update the Emacs packages used by Spacemacs press RET (enter) or click on the
link =[Update Packages]= in the startup page under the banner then restart
Emacs. If you prefer, you can use the command
=configuration-layer/update-packages= instead of the button.

If anything goes wrong you should be able to rollback the update by pressing
~RET~ or clicking on the =[Rollback Package Update]= link next to the =[Update
Packages]= link and choose a rollback slot (sorted by date). This button uses
the command =configuration-layer/rollback=.

* Configuration layers
*Note*: This is a very simple overview of how layers work. A more extensive
introduction to writing configuration layers can be found [[file:LAYERS.org][here]].

** Purpose
Layers help collect related packages together to provide features. For example,
the =python= layer provides auto-completion, syntax checking, and repl support
for python files. This approach helps keep configuration organized and reduces
overhead for the user by keeping them from having to think about what packages
to install

** Structure
Configuration is organized in layers. Each layer has the following structure:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    [layer_name]
      |__ [local]
      | |__ [package 1]
      | |     ...
      | |__ [package n]
      |__ config.el
      |__ funcs.el
      |__ keybindings.el
      |__ packages.el

    [] = directory
#+END_EXAMPLE

Where:

| File           | Usage                                                                |
|----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| config.el      | Emacs built-in configuration or mandatory configuration              |
| funcs.el       | Various functions and macros (often used in keybindings.el)          |
| keybindings.el | Emacs built-in key bindings or mandatory key bindings                |
| packages.el    | The list of packages to install and the functions to initialize them |

=Packages= are =ELPA= packages which can be installed from an =ELPA= compliant
repository, local packages in a layer's =local= folder, or packages that can be
installed from an online source using [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa][quelpa]].

** Packages
*** Within a layer
**** Declaration
=Packages= are declared in variables and =<layer>-packages= where =<layer>= is
the layer name. They are processed in alphabetical order so sometimes you'll
have to use some =eval-after-load= black magic.

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq <layer>-packages '(package1 package2 ...)
#+END_SRC

For details on installing local packages using quelpa or in the layer's =local=
folder, see [[file:LAYERS.org::packages.el][LAYERS]].

**** Initialization
To initialize an extension or a package =xxx=, define a function with this
format in or =packages.el=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun <layer>/init-xxx () ...body )
#+END_SRC

It is common to define the body with the [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] macro.

**** Exclusion
It is possible to exclude some packages from Spacemacs on a per layer basis.
This is useful when a configuration layer aims to replace a stock package
declared in the Spacemacs layer.

To do so add the package names to exclude to the variable
=<layer>-excluded-packages=.

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq <layer>-excluded-packages '(package1 package2 ...)
#+END_SRC

*** Without a layer
Sometimes a layer can be an unnecessary overhead, this is the case if you just
want to install a package without any configuration associated to it. A good
example is some niche language where you are only interested syntax
highlighting.

You can install such packages by adding them to the variable
=dotspacemacs-additional-packages= in your dotfile.

If you want to add some configuration for them then consider to create a layer,
or just put the configuration in the =dotspacemacs/user-config= function.

Example to install =llvm-mode= and =dts-mode=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq dotspacemacs-additional-packages '(llvm-mode dts-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Packages synchronization (Vundle like feature)
Spacemacs features a synchronization engine for the ELPA packages. It means
that Spacemacs will auto-install the new packages in =<layer>-packages= lists
/and/ auto-delete orphan packages in your =elpa= directory.

It effectively makes Spacemacs behave like [[https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim][Vundle]].

** Types of configuration layers
There are three types of configuration layers:
  - core (this is the Spacemacs layer)
  - private (in the =private= directory, they are ignored by Git)
  - contrib (in the =layers= directory, those layers are contributions shared
    by the community and merged upstream).

** Submitting a configuration layer upstream
If you decide to provide a =contrib= configuration layer, please check the
contribution guidelines in [[file:../CONTRIBUTING.org][CONTRIBUTING]].

** Example: Themes Megapack example
This is a simple =contrib= configuration layer listing a bunch of themes, you
can find it [[../layers/themes-megapack][here]].

To install it, just add =themes-megapack= to your =~/.spacemacs= like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(themes-megapack))
#+END_SRC

You have now installed around 100 themes you are free to try with ~SPC T h~
(helm-themes).

** Managing private configuration layers
Spacemacs configuration system is flexible enough to let you manage your
private layers in different ways.

*** Using the private directory
Everything in the private directory is ignored by Git so it is a good place to
store private layers. There is a huge drawback to this approach though: /your
layers are not source controlled/.

*** Using an external Git repository
This is the recommended way to manage your private layers.

The best approach is to store all your private layers into an external Git
repository. It is especially a good practice to store them in your =dotfiles=
repository if you have one. Put also your =~/.spacemacs= file in it.

Then you are free to symlink your layers into =~/emacs.d/private= /or/ let them
anywhere you want and reference the parent directory in the variable
=dotspacemacs-configuration-layer-path= of your =~/.spacemacs=.

Note that you could also have a dedicated repository for all your private layers
and then directly clone this repository in =~/.emacs.d/private=.

*** Using a personal branch
The final main way to manage your private layers is to push them in a personal
branch that you keep up to date with upstream =master= or =develop=.

** Tips for writing layers
Please refer to [[file:LAYERS.org][this]] introduction for some tips on writing layers, and how to
best make them fit with the Spacemacs philosophy and loading strategy.

* Dotfile Configuration
User configuration can be stored in your =~/.spacemacs= file.

** Installation
The very first time Spacemacs starts up, it will prompt you to choose your
editing style. Once you choose a style, the =.spacemacs= file will be created
from a template.

*** Alternative setup
Since v0.104 you have the option of using =~/.spacemacs.d/init.el= for your
dotfile instead of =~/.spacemacs=. If you want to use this option, simply move
=~/.spacemacs= to =~/.spacemacs.d/init.el=. =~/.spacemacs= will always take
priority over =~/.spacemacs.d/init.el=, so =~/.spacemacs= must be missing for
=~/.spacemacs.d/init.el= to be used by spacemacs.

If you use this option, everything that applies to =~/.spacemacs= in this guide
will now apply to =~/.spacemacs.d/init.el=.

It is also possible to override the location of =~/.spacemacs.d/= using the
environment variable =SPACEMACSDIR=. Of course you can also use symlinks to
change the location of this directory.

** Synchronization of dotfile changes
To apply the modifications made in =~/.spacemacs= press ~SPC f e R~. It will
re-execute the Spacemacs initialization process.

*Note*: A synchronization re-executes the functions =dotspacemacs/init= and
=dotspacemacs/user-config=. Depending on the content of this functions you may
encounter some unwanted side effects. For instance if you use a toggle in
=dotspacemac/user-config= to enable some behavior, this behavior will be turned
off whenever the dotfile is re-synchronized. To avoid these side-effects it is
recommended to either use =setq= expressions instead of toggle functions, or to
use the =on= or =off= versions instead (i.e. instead of
=spacemacs/toggle-<thing>=, use =spacemacs/toggle-<thing>-on= or
=spacemacs/toggle-<thing>-off=). It is possible to /skip/ the execution of
=dotspacemacs/user-config= with the universal argument (~SPC u SPC f e R~).

** Testing
You can use the command =SPC : dotspacemacs/test-dotfile= to check if your
=~/.spacemacs= looks correct. This will check, among other things, whether the
declared layers can be found and that the variables have sensible values. These
tests are also run automatically when you synchronize with ~SPC f e R~.

** Content
*** Using configuration layers
To use a configuration layer, add it to the =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers=
variable of your =~/.spacemacs=.

For instance to add the configuration layer of [[Thank you][RMS]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(rms))
#+END_SRC

If this layer does not exist you can still try another one in [[file:../layers][the =layers=
directory]].

Configuration layers are expected to be stored in =~/.emacs.d/private= or
=~/.emacs.d/layers=. But you are free to keep them somewhere else by declaring
additional paths where Spacemacs can look for configuration layers. This is
done by setting the list =dotspacemacs-configuration-layer-path= in your
=~/.spacemacs=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layer-path '("~/.myconfig/"))
#+END_SRC

*** Setting configuration layers variables
Some configuration layers have configuration variables to enable specific
support. For instance the [[../layers/%2Bsource-control/git][git layer]] has several configuration variables, they
can be set directly in the =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/layers ()
  ;; List of configuration layers to load.
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(auto-completion
                                                    (git :variables
                                                         git-magit-status-fullscreen t)
                                                    smex)))
#+END_SRC

*** Excluding packages
You can exclude packages you don't want to install with the variable
=dotspacemacs-excluded-packages=, this variable can exclude both packages and
extensions (see [[Configuration layers][Configuration layers]] for more info on
packages and extensions).

For instance to disable the =rainbow-delimiters= package:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-excluded-packages '(rainbow-delimiters))
#+END_SRC

When you exclude a package, Spacemacs will automatically delete it for you the
next time you launch Emacs. All the orphan dependencies are as well delete
automatically.

*** Hooks
Three special functions of the =~/.spacemacs= file can be used to perform
configuration at the beginning and end of Spacemacs loading process.

  - =dotspacemacs/init= is triggered at the very beginning of Spacemacs
    loading. You can configure Spacemacs variables here.
  - =dotspacemacs/user-init= is also triggered at the very beginning of Spacemacs
    loading. User initialization occurs here.
  - =dotspacemacs/user-config= is triggered at the very end of Spacemacs
    loading. Most user configuration should go here.

*** Binding keys
Key sequences are bound to commands in Emacs in various keymaps. The most basic
map is the global-map. Setting a key binding the global-map uses the function
=global-set-key= as follows (to the command =forward-char= in this case).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-]") 'forward-char)
#+END_SRC

The =kbd= macro accepts a string describing a key sequence. The global-map is
often shadowed by other maps. For example, evil-mode defines keymaps that target
states (or modes in vim terminology). Here is an example that creates the same
binding as above but only in insert state (=define-key= is a built-in function.
Evil-mode has its own functions for defining keys).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-key evil-insert-state-map (kbd "C-]") 'forward-char)
#+END_SRC

Perhaps most importantly for spacemacs is the use of the evil-leader package,
which binds keys to the evil-leader keymap. This is where most of the spacemacs
bindings live. There are two related commands from this package which are used
as follows.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(spacemacs/set-leader-keys "C-]" 'forward-char)
(spacemacs/set-leader-keys-for-major-mode 'emacs-lisp-mode "C-]" 'forward-char)
#+END_SRC

These functions use a macro like =kbd= to translate the key sequences for you.
The second function, =spacemacs/set-leader-keys-for-major-mode=, binds the key only in the
specified mode. The second key binding would not be in effect in =org-mode= for
example.

Finally, one should be aware of prefix keys. Essentially, all keymaps can be
nested. Nested keymaps are used extensively in spacemacs, and in vanilla Emacs
for that matter. For example, ~SPC a~ points to key bindings for "applications",
like ~SPC ac~ for =calc-dispatch=. Nesting bindings is easy.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(spacemacs/declare-prefix "]" "bracket-prefix")
(spacemacs/set-leader-keys "]]" 'double-bracket-command)
#+END_SRC

The first line declares ~SPC ]~ to be a prefix and the second binds the key
sequence ~SPC ]]~ to the corresponding command. The first line is actually
unnecessary to create the prefix, but it will give your new prefix a name that
key-discovery tools can use (e.g., which-key).

There is much more to say about bindings keys, but these are the basics. Keys
can be bound in your =~/.spacemacs= file or in individual layers.

*** Custom variables
Custom variables configuration from =M-x customize-group= which are
automatically saved by Emacs are stored at the end of your =~/.spacemacs= file.

* Main principles
** Editing Styles
*** Vim
Spacemacs behaves like in Vim using [[https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home][Evil]] mode package to emulate Vim key bindings.
This is the default style of Spacemacs, it can be set explicitly by setting
the =dotspacemacs-editing-style= variable to =vim= in the dotfile.

*** Emacs
Spacemacs behaves like in raw Emacs using the Holy mode which configures Evil to
make the emacs state the default state everywhere.
Set the =dotspacemacs-editing-style= variable to =emacs= in the dotfile.

In Emacs style the leader is available on ~M-m~. It is possible to dynamically
switch between evil and holy mode using ~SPC t E h~ and ~M-m t E h~.

*** Hybrid
The hybrid editing style is like the Vim style except that insert state
has all the Emacs key bindings available like in emacs state. The insert state
in hybrid mode is called the hybrid state and you have to map your key bindings
in =evil-hybrid-state-map= keymap instead of =evil-insert-state-map=.

Hybrid mode can be enabled by setting =dotspacemacs-editing-style= to =hybrid=.
To switch between evil and hybrid mode use ~SPC t E y~ and ~M-m t E y~.

The default state in hybrid mode can be changed by setting the variable
=hybrid-mode-default-state= to a state value, the default is =normal=, set it
to =hybrid= to start in hybrid insert state instead of normal state.

** Evilified modes
Some buffers (such as Magit, for using git from within Emacs), are not for
editing text, and provide their own keybindings for certain operations. These
often conflict with Vim bindings. To make such buffers behave Vim-like in a
consistent manner, they use a special state called /evilified/ state. In
evilified state, a handful of keys work as in Evil, namely =/=, =:=, =h=, =j=,
=k=, =l=, =n=, =N=, =v=, =V=, =gg=, =G=, =C-f=, =C-b=, =C-d=, =C-e=, =C-u=,
=C-y= and =C-z=.
All other keys work as intended by the underlying mode.

Shadowed keys are moved according to the pattern: =a= → =A= → =C-a= → =C-A=

For example, if the mode binds a function to =n=, that is found under =C-n= in
evilified state, since both =n= and =N= are reserved, but =C-n= is not. On the
other hand, anything originally bound to =k= will be found on =K=, since =k= is
reserved but =K= is not. If there is a binding on =K=, that will be moved to
=C-k=.

In addition to this, =C-g=, being an important escape key in Emacs, is skipped.
So anything bound to =g= originally will be found on =C-G=, since =g=, =G= and
=C-g= are all reserved.

** States
Spacemacs has 10 states:

| State        | Color       | Description                                                                                                |
|--------------+-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| normal       | orange      | like the =normal mode of Vim=, used to execute and combine commands                                        |
| insert       | green       | like the =insert mode of Vim=, used to actually insert text                                                |
| visual       | gray        | like the =visual mode of Vim=, used to make text selection                                                 |
| motion       | purple      | exclusive to =Evil=, used to navigate read only buffers                                                    |
| emacs        | blue        | exclusive to =Evil=, using this state is like using a regular Emacs without Vim                            |
| replace      | chocolate   | exclusive to =Evil=, overwrites the character under point instead of inserting a new one                   |
| hybrid       | blue        | exclusive to Spacemacs, this is like the insert state except that all the emacs key bindings are available |
| evilified    | light brown | exclusive to Spacemacs, this is an =emacs state= modified to bring Vim navigation, selection and search.   |
| lisp         | pink        | exclusive to Spacemacs, used to navigate Lisp code and modify it (more [[Editing Lisp code][info]])                               |
| iedit        | red         | exclusive to Spacemacs, used to navigate between multiple regions of text using =iedit= (more [[Replacing text with iedit][info]])        |
| iedit-insert | red         | exclusive to Spacemacs, used to replace multiple regions of text using =iedit= (more [[Replacing text with iedit][info]])                 |

Note: Technically speaking there is also the =operator= evil state.

** Evil leader
Spacemacs heavily uses the [[https://github.com/cofi/evil-leader][evil-leader]] mode which brings the Vim leader key to
the Emacs world.

This leader key is commonly set to ~,~ by Vim users, in Spacemacs the leader
key is set on ~SPC~ (space bar, hence the name =spacemacs=). This key is the
most accessible key on a keyboard and it is pressed with the thumb which is a
good choice to lower the risk of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury][RSI]].

So with Spacemacs there is no need to remap your keyboard modifiers to attempt
to reduce the risk of RSI, every command can be executed very easily while you
are in =normal= mode by pressing the ~SPC~ leader key, here are a few examples:

-  Save a buffer: ~SPC f s~
-  Save all opened buffers: ~SPC f S~
-  Open (switch) to a buffer with =helm=: ~SPC b b~

** Universal argument
The universal argument ~C-u~ is an important command in Emacs but it is also a
very handy Vim key binding to scroll up.

Spacemacs binds ~C-u~ to =scroll-up= and change the universal argument binding
to ~SPC u~.

*Note*: ~SPC u~ is not working before =helm-M-x= (~SPC :~). Instead, call
=helm-M-x= first, select the command you want to run, and press ~C-u~ before
pressing ~RETURN~. For instance: ~SPC : org-reload C-u RET~

** Micro-states
Spacemacs defines a wide variety of =micro-states= (temporary overlay maps)
where it makes sense. This prevents one from doing repetitive and tedious
presses on the ~SPC~ key.

When a =micro-state= is active, a documentation is displayed in the minibuffer.
Additional information may as well be displayed in the minibuffer.

Auto-highlight-symbol micro-state:
[[file:img/spacemacs-ahs-micro-state.png]]

[[Text][Text scale micro-state]]:
[[file:img/spacemacs-scale-micro-state.png]]

* Differences between Vim, Evil and Spacemacs
- The ~,~ key does "repeat last ~f~, ~t~, ~F~, or ~T~ command in
  opposite direction in =Vim=, but in Spacemacs it is the major mode specific
  leader key by default (which can be set on another key binding in the
  dotfile).
- The ~Y~ key does not yank the whole line. It yanks from the current point to
  the end of the line. This is more consistent with the behavior of ~C~ and ~D~
  and is also recommended by the vim documentation.

Send a PR to add the differences you found in this section.

** The vim-surround case
There is one obvious visible difference though. It is not between =Evil= and
=Vim= but between Spacemacs and [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround][vim-surround]]: in visual mode the =surround= command is on ~S~
in =vim-surround= whereas it is on ~s~ in Spacemacs.

This is something that can surprise some Vim users so let me explain why this is
the case:
  - ~s~ and ~c~ do the same thing in =visual state=,
  - ~s~ is only useful to delete /one/ character and add more than one character
    which is a /very/ narrow use case
  - ~c~ accept motions and can do everything ~s~ can do in =normal state=
    - this is also true for ~r~ but ~r~ is more useful because it stays in =normal state=
  - =surround= command is just a more powerful command than ~s~.

If you are not convinced, then here is the snippet to revert back to the default
=Vim + vim-surround= setup (add it to your =dotspacemacs/user-config= function or
your =~/.spacemacs=):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(evil-define-key 'visual evil-surround-mode-map "s" 'evil-substitute)
(evil-define-key 'visual evil-surround-mode-map "S" 'evil-surround-region)
#+END_SRC

* Evil plugins
Spacemacs ships with the following evil plugins:

| Mode                          | Description                                              |
|-------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------|
| [[https://github.com/cofi/evil-leader][evil-leader]]                   | vim leader that bring a new layer of keys in normal mode |
| [[https://github.com/cofi/evil-indent-textobject][evil-indent-textobject]]        | add text object based on indentation level               |
| [[https://github.com/bling/evil-visualstar][evil-visualstar]]               | search for current selection with ~*~                    |

* Spacemacs UI
Spacemacs has unique UI elements to make the Emacs experience even more
enjoyable:
  - dedicated startup page with a mode aimed at easily managing Spacemacs
  - dedicated helm source via =helm-spacemacs=
  - a [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] buffer

** Graphical UI
Spacemacs has a minimalistic and distraction free graphical UI:
  - custom [[https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline][powerline]] mode-line [[Flycheck integration][with color feedback]] according to current [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][Flycheck]] status
  - Unicode symbols for minor mode lighters which appear in the mode-line
  - [[Errors handling][custom fringe bitmaps]] and error feedbacks for [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][Flycheck]]

*** Color themes

The official Spacemacs theme is [[https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme][spacemacs-dark]] and it is the default theme
installed when you first started Spacemacs. There are two variants of the
theme, a dark one and a light one. Some aspect of these themes can be customized
in the function =dotspacemacs/user-init= of your =~/.spacemacs=:
  - the comment background with the boolean =spacemacs-theme-comment-bg=
  - the height of org section titles with =spacemacs-theme-org-height=

It is possible to define your default themes in your =~/.spacemacs= with the
variable =dotspacemacs-themes=. For instance, to specify =solarized-light=,
=leuven= and =zenburn=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-themes '(solarized-light leuven zenburn))
#+END_SRC

| Key Binding | Description                                           |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC T n~   | switch to next theme listed in =dotspacemacs-themes=. |
| ~SPC T h~   | select a theme using a =helm= buffer.                 |

You can see samples of all included themes in this [[http://themegallery.robdor.com][theme gallery]] from [[http://www.twitter.com/robmerrell][Rob Merrell]].

*Note*:
  - You don't need to explicitly list in a layer the theme packages you are
    defining in =dotspacemacs-themes=, Spacemacs is smart enough to remove those
    packages from the list of orphans.
  - Due to the inner working of themes in Emacs, switching theme during the same
    session may have some weird side effects. Although these side effects should
    be pretty rare.
  - In the terminal version of Emacs, color themes will not render correctly as
    colors are rendered by the terminal and not by emacs. You will probably have
    to change your terminal color palette. More explanations can be found on
    [[https://github.com/sellout/emacs-color-theme-solarized#important-note-for-terminal-users][emacs-color-theme-solarized webpage]].

*Hint*: If you are an =Org= user, [[https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme][leuven-theme]] is amazing ;-)

*** Font
The default font used by Spacemacs is [[https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro][Source Code Pro]] by Adobe. It is
recommended to install it on your system.

To change the default font set the variable =dotspacemacs-default-font= in your
=.spacemacs= file.

By default its value is:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-default-font '("Source Code Pro"
                                          :size 13
                                          :weight normal
                                          :width normal
                                          :powerline-scale 1.1))
#+END_SRC

The properties should be pretty straightforward, it is possible to set any valid
property of a [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Low_002dLevel-Font.html][font-spec]]:
  - =:family= Font family or fontset (a string).
  - =:width= Relative character width. This should be one of the symbols:
    - ultra-condensed
    - extra-condensed
    - condensed
    - semi-condensed
    - normal
    - semi-expanded
    - expanded
    - extra-expanded
    - ultra-expanded
  - =:height= The height of the font. In the simplest case, this is an integer
    in units of 1/10 point.
  - =:weight= Font weight- one of the symbols (from densest to faintest):
    - ultra-bold
    - extra-bold
    - bold
    - semi-bold
    - normal
    - semi-light
    - light
    - extra-light
    - ultra-light
  - =:slant= Font slant- one of the symbols:
    - italic
    - oblique
    - normal
    - reverse-italic
    - reverse-oblique
  - =:size= The font size- either a non-negative integer that specifies the
    pixel size, or a floating-point number that specifies the point size.
  - =:adstyle= Additional typographic style information for the font, such as
    'sans'. The value should be a string or a symbol.
  - =:registry= The charset registry and encoding of the font, such as
    'iso8859-1'. The value should be a string or a symbol.
  - =:script= The script that the font must support (a symbol).

The special property =:powerline-scale= is Spacemacs specific and it is for
quick tweaking of the mode-line height in order to avoid crappy rendering of the
separators like on the following screenshot (default value is 1.1).

/Ugly separators/

[[file:img/crappy-powerline-separators.png]]

*** Graphical UI Toggles
Some graphical UI indicators can be toggled on and off (toggles start with ~t~
and ~T~):

| Key Binding | Description                                                       |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC t f~   | display the fill column (by default the fill column is set to 80) |
| ~SPC t h h~ | toggle highlight of the current line                              |
| ~SPC t h i~ | toggle highlight indentation levels                               |
| ~SPC t h c~ | toggle highlight indentation current column                       |
| ~SPC t i~   | toggle indentation guide at point                                 |
| ~SPC t l~   | toggle truncate lines                                             |
| ~SPC t L~   | toggle visual lines                                               |
| ~SPC t n~   | toggle line numbers                                               |
| ~SPC t v~   | toggle smooth scrolling                                           |

| Key Binding | Description                                                  |
|-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC T ~~   | display =~= in the fringe on empty lines                     |
| ~SPC T F~   | toggle frame fullscreen                                      |
| ~SPC T f~   | toggle display of the fringe                                 |
| ~SPC T m~   | toggle menu bar                                              |
| ~SPC T M~   | toggle frame maximize                                        |
| ~SPC T t~   | toggle tool bar                                              |
| ~SPC T T~   | toggle frame transparency and enter transparency micro-state |

*Note*: These toggles are all available via the =helm-spacemacs= interface (press
~SPC h SPC~ to display the =helm-spacemacs= buffer).

**** Global line numbers
Line numbers can be toggled on in all =prog-mode= and =text-mode= buffers by
setting the =dotspacemacs-line-numbers= variable in your =~/.spacemacs=
to something different than =nil=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-line-numbers t)
#+END_SRC

If it is set to =relative=, line numbers are show in a relative way:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-line-numbers 'relative)
#+END_SRC

*** Mouse usage
There are some added mouse features set for the line number margin (if shown):

-  single click in line number margin visually selects the entire line
-  drag across line number margin visually selects the region
-  double click in line number margin visually select the current code block

*** Mode-line
The mode line is a heavily customized [[https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline][powerline]] with the following capabilities:
  - show the window number
  - color code for current state
  - show the number of search occurrences via anzu
  - toggle flycheck info
  - toggle battery info
  - toggle minor mode lighters

Reminder of the color codes for the states:

| Evil State         | Color     |
|--------------------+-----------|
| Normal             | Orange    |
| Insert             | Green     |
| Visual             | Grey      |
| Emacs              | Blue      |
| Motion             | Purple    |
| Replace            | Chocolate |
| Lisp               | Pink      |
| Iedit/Iedit-Insert | Red       |

Some elements can be dynamically toggled:

| Key Binding | Description                                                     |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC t m b~ | toggle the battery status                                       |
| ~SPC t m c~ | toggle the =org= task clock (available in =org= layer)          |
| ~SPC t m m~ | toggle the minor mode lighters                                  |
| ~SPC t m M~ | toggle the major mode                                           |
| ~SPC t m n~ | toggle the cat! (if =colors= layer is declared in your dotfile) |
| ~SPC t m p~ | toggle the point character position                             |
| ~SPC t m t~ | toggle the mode line itself                                     |
| ~SPC t m v~ | toggle the version control info                                 |
| ~SPC t m V~ | toggle the new version lighter                                  |

**** Powerline font installation for terminal-mode users
Users who run Emacs in terminal mode may need to install the [[https://github.com/powerline/fonts][Powerline patched
fonts]] and configure their terminal clients to use them to make the Powerline
separators render correctly.

**** Flycheck integration
When [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][Flycheck]] minor mode is enabled, a new element appears showing the number of
errors, warnings and info.

#+CAPTION: powerline-wave

[[file:img/powerline-wave.png]]

**** Anzu integration
[[https://github.com/syohex/emacs-anzu][Anzu]] shows the number of occurrence when performing a search. Spacemacs
integrates nicely the Anzu status by displaying it temporarily when ~n~ or ~N~
are being pressed. See the =5/6= segment on the screenshot below.

#+CAPTION: powerline-anzu

[[file:img/powerline-anzu.png]]

**** Battery status integration
[[https://github.com/lunaryorn/fancy-battery.el][fancy-battery]] displays the percentage of total charge of the battery as well as
the time remaining to charge or discharge completely the battery.

A color code is used for the battery status:

| Battery State | Color  |
|---------------+--------|
| Charging      | Green  |
| Discharging   | Orange |
| Critical      | Red    |

Note the these colors may vary depending on your theme.

**** Powerline separators
It is possible to easily customize the =powerline separator= by setting the
=powerline-default-separator= variable in your =~./spacemacs=. For instance if
you want to set back the separator to the well-known =arrow= separator add the
following snippet to your configuration file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
  "This is were you can ultimately override default Spacemacs configuration.
This function is called at the very end of Spacemacs initialization."
  (setq powerline-default-separator 'arrow))
#+END_SRC

To save you the time to try all the possible separators provided by the
powerline, here is an exhaustive set of screenshots:

| Separator    | Screenshot                        |
|--------------+-----------------------------------|
| =alternate=  | [[file:img/powerline-alternate.png]]  |
| =arrow=      | [[file:img/powerline-arrow.png]]      |

**** Minor Modes
Spacemacs uses [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiminishedModes][diminish]] mode to reduce the size of minor mode indicators:

The minor mode area can be toggled on and off with ~SPC t m m~

Unicode symbols are displayed by default. Setting the variable
=dotspacemacs-mode-line-unicode-symbols= to =nil= in your =~/.spacemacs= will
display ASCII characters instead (may be useful in terminal if you cannot set an
appropriate font).

The letters displayed in the mode-line correspond to the key bindings used to
toggle them.

Some toggle have two flavors: local and global. The global version of the toggle
can be reached using the =control= key.

| Key Binding | Unicode | ASCII | Mode                                        |

**** Customizing the mode-line
Spacemacs uses [[https://github.com/TheBB/spaceline][Spaceline]] to provide its mode-line. It consists of a number of
/segments/ arranged on the left and right sides. These are defined in the
variables =spaceline-left= and =spaceline-right=. Segments can be defined using
=spaceline-define-segment=, and added to the appropriate location in the left or
right hand side variables.

Please see the Spaceline documentation for more information.

* Commands
** Vim key bindings
Spacemacs is based on =Vim= modal user interface to navigate and edit text. If
you are not familiar with the =Vim= way of editing text you can try the
[[https://github.com/syl20bnr/evil-tutor][evil-tutor]] lessons by pressing ~SPC h T~ at any time.

*** Escaping
Spacemacs uses [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/evil-escape][evil-escape]] to
easily switch between =insert state= and =normal state= by quickly pressing the
~fd~ keys.

The choice of ~fd~ was made to be able to use the same sequence to escape from
"everything" in Emacs:
  - escape from all stock evil states to normal state
  - escape from evil-lisp-state to normal state
  - escape from evil-iedit-state to normal state
  - abort evil ex command
  - quit minibuffer
  - abort isearch
  - quit magit buffers
  - quit help buffers
  - quit apropos buffers
  - quit ert buffers
  - quit undo-tree buffer
  - quit paradox
  - quit gist-list menu
  - quit helm-ag-edit
  - hide neotree buffer

If you find yourself in a buffer where the Spacemacs (~SPC~) or Vim
keybindings don't work you can use this to get back to =normal state= (for
example in ~SPC : customize~ press ~fd~ to make ~SPC b b~ work again).

This sequence can be customized in your =~/.spacemacs=.
Example to set it to ~jj~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
  (setq-default evil-escape-key-sequence "jj"))
#+END_SRC

*Note*: Although ~jj~ or ~jk~ are popular choices of vim users, these key
sequences are not optimal for Spacemacs. Indeed it is very easy in =visual
state= to press quickly ~jj~ and inadvertently escape to =normal state=.

*** Executing Vim and Emacs ex/M-x commands
| Command          | Key Binding |
|------------------+-------------|
| Vim (ex-command) | ~:~         |
| Emacs (M-x)      | ~SPC :~     |

The command key ~:~ can be easily changed with the variable
=dotspacemacs-command-key= of your =~/.spacemacs=. Note that is will change both
~:~ and ~SPC :~ bindings to keep the symmetry between Vim and Emacs. A good key
can be ~,~ for example.

*** Leader key
On top of =Vim= modes (modes are called states in Spacemacs) there is a
special key called the leader key which once pressed gives a whole new keyboard
layer. The leader key is by default ~SPC~ (space). It is possible to change this
key with the variable =dotspacemacs-leader-key=.

*** Additional text objects
Additional text objects are defined in Spacemacs:

| Object  | Description                |
|---------+----------------------------|
| ~a~     | an argument                |
| ~g~     | the entire buffer          |
| ~$~     | text between =$=           |
| ~*~     | text between =*=           |
| ~8~     | text between =/*= and =*/= |
| ~%~     | text between =%=           |
| ~\vert~ | text between =\vert=       |

** Reserved prefix command for user
~SPC o~ and ~SPC m o~ are reserved for the user. Setting key bindings behind
these is *guaranteed* to never conflict with Spacemacs default key bindings.

*Example:* Put =(spacemacs/set-leader-keys "oc" 'org-capture)= inside
=dotspacemacs/user-config= in your =~/.spacemacs= file, to be able to use ~SPC o
c~ to run org mode capture.

** Helm
Spacemacs is powered by [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] which is an incremental completion and selection
narrowing framework.

=Helm= is the central control tower of Spacemacs, it is used to manage
buffers, projects, search results, configuration layers, toggles and more...

Mastering =Helm= will make you a Spacemacs power user. Do not hesitate to read
the [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki][Helm documentation wiki]].

*** C-z and Tab switch
The command bound to ~C-z~ is much more useful than the one bound to Tab, so it
makes sense to swap them. It's also recommended [[http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html][here]].

*** Helm focus
If you find yourself unable to return focus to Helm (after a careless
mouse-click for example), use ~SPC w b~ to return focus to the minibuffer.

*** Helm micro-state
Spacemacs defines a [[Micro-states][micro-state]] for =Helm= to make it work like [[https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim][Vim's Unite]]
plugin.

Initiate the micro-state with ~M-SPC~ or ~s-M-SPC~ while in a =Helm= buffer.

| Key Binding          | Description                                      |
|----------------------+--------------------------------------------------|
| ~M-SPC~ or ~s-M-SPC~ | initiate the micro-state                         |
| ~q~                  | quit micro-state                                 |
| ~TAB~                | switch to actions page and leave the micro-state |
| ~1~                  | execute action 0                                 |

| ~G~                  | go to last candidate                             |
| ~h~                  | go to previous source                            |
| ~j~                  | select next candidate                            |
| ~k~                  | select previous candidate                        |
| ~l~                  | go to next source                                |
| ~t~                  | mark current candidate                           |
| ~T~                  | mark all candidates                              |
| ~v~                  | execute persistent action                        |

** Discovering
*** Key bindings
**** Which-key
A help buffer is displayed each time the ~SPC~ key is pressed in normal mode.
It lists the available key bindings and their associated commands.

By default the [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] buffer will be displayed quickly after the key has been
pressed. You can change the delay by setting the variable
=dotspacemacs-which-key-delay= to your liking (the value is in second).

**** Helm describe key bindings
It is possible to search for specific key bindings by pressing ~SPC ?~.

To narrow the list to some key bindings using the leader key type a pattern like
this regular expression: ~SPC\ b~ which would list all =buffer= related
bindings.

*** Getting help
=Describe functions= are powerful Emacs introspection commands to get
information about functions, variables, modes etc. These commands are bound
thusly:

| Key Binding | Description                                               |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|

| ~SPC h d p~ | describe a package                                        |
| ~SPC h d s~ | copy system information that you can paste in gitter chat |
| ~SPC h d t~ | describe a theme                                          |
| ~SPC h d v~ | describe a variable                                       |

Other help key bindings:

| Key Binding | Description                                                        |

| ~SPC h I~       | Open a page for creating a new Spacemacs issue on GitHub with information pre-filled |
| ~SPC u SPC h I~ | Open a page for creating a new Spacemacs issue on GitHub with information pre-filled |

/Note:/ If these two bindings are used with the =*Backtrace*= buffer open, the
backtrace is automatically included

*** Available layers
All layers can be easily discovered via =helm-spacemacs= accessible with ~SPC f
e h~.

The following helm actions are available:
  - default: open the layer =README.org=
  - 2nd: open the layer =packages.el=
  - 3nd: open the layer =extensions.el=

**** Available packages in Spacemacs
=helm-spacemacs= also lists all the packages available in Spacemacs. The entry
format is =(layer) packages=. If you type =flycheck= you'll be able to see all
the layers where =flycheck= is used.

The following helm actions are available on packages:
  - default: go the package init function

**** New packages from ELPA repositories
=package-list-packages= is where you can browse for all available packages in the
different Elpa repositories. It is possible to upgrade packages from there but
it is not recommended, use the =[Update Packages]= link on the Spacemacs startup
page instead.

Spacemacs uses [[https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/paradox][Paradox]] instead of =package-list-packages= to list available
ELPA packages. Paradox enhances the package list buffer with better feedbacks,
new filters and Github information like the number of stars. Optionally you can
also star packages directly in the buffer.

*Important Note 1*: Installing a new package from =Paradox= won't make it
persistent. To install a package persistently you have to add it explicitly to a
configuration layer.

*Important Note 2*: Don't /update/ your packages from =Paradox= or
=package-list-packages= because they don't support the rollback feature of
Spacemacs.

| ~x~         | execute (action flags)                                |

*** Toggles
=helm-spacemacs= is also a central place to discover the available toggles. To
display only the toggles source press ~C-l~ (or in [[Helm micro-state][Helm micro-state]] you can
press just ~l~).

The following helm actions are available on packages:
  - default: toggle on/off

*Tips* Use ~SPC h l~ to resume the last helm session. It is handy to quickly
toggle on and off a toggle.

** Navigating
*** Point/Cursor
Navigation is performed using the Vi key bindings ~hjkl~.

| ~SPC t -~   | lock the cursor at the center of the screen                                       |

**** Smooth scrolling
[[https://github.com/aspiers/smooth-scrolling][smooth-scrolling]] prevent the point to jump when it reaches the top or
bottom of the screen. It is enabled by default.

On Windows, you may want to disable it. To disable the smooth scrolling set the
=dotspacemacs-smooth-scrolling= variable in your =~/.spacemacs= to =nil=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-smooth-scrolling nil)
#+END_SRC

You can also toggle smooth scrolling with ~SPC t v~.

*** Vim motions with avy
Spacemacs uses the =evil= integration of [[https://github.com/abo-abo/avy][avy]] which enables the
invocation of =avy= during motions.

For instance, it is useful for deleting a set of visual lines from the current line.
Try the following sequence in a buffer containing some text: ~d SPC j l~, followed by
selecting an avy candidate.

| Key Binding | Description                                        |
|-------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC j j~   | initiate avy jump char                             |
| ~SPC j w~   | initiate avy jump word                             |
| ~SPC j l~   | initiate avy jump line                             |
| ~SPC j u~   | go back to the previous location (before the jump) |

**** ace-link mode
Similar to =avy=, [[https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-link][ace-link]] allows one to jump to any link in
=help-mode= and =info-mode= with two key strokes.

| Key Binding | Description                                           |

| ~o~         | initiate ace link mode in =help-mode= and =info-mode= |

*** Window manipulation
**** Window manipulation key bindings
Every window has a number displayed at the start of the mode-line and
can be quickly accessed using =SPC number=.

**** Window manipulation micro-state
A convenient window manipulation micro-state allows to perform most of the
actions listed above. The micro-state allows additional actions as well like
window resizing.

**** Golden ratio
If you resize windows like crazy you may want to give a try to [[https://github.com/roman/golden-ratio.el][golden-ratio]].

=golden-ratio= resizes windows dynamically depending on whether they are
selected or not. By default =golden-ratio= is off.

The mode can be toggled on and off with ~SPC t g~.

*** Buffers and Files
Since =helm= is used everywhere, by default Spacemacs uses =helm= to open files.

Some users prefer the =ido= way to navigate the file system because it can
remember the last selected directories and buffers and ~RET~ is used to open
directories instead of ~TAB~ or ~C-z~ in =helm=. It is possible to use =ido=
instead of =helm= by setting the variable =dotspacemacs-use-ido= to =t= in your
dotfile.

**** Buffers manipulation key bindings
Buffer manipulation commands (start with ~b~):

| Key Binding | Description                                                              |

**** Buffers manipulation micro-state
A convenient buffer manipulation micro-state allows to quickly cycles through
the opened buffer and kill them.

| Key Binding   | Description                                   |
|---------------+-----------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC b .~     | initiate micro-state                          |
| ~K~           | kill current buffer                           |
| ~n~           | go to next buffer (avoid special buffers)     |
| ~N~           | go to previous buffer (avoid special buffers) |
| Any other key | leave the micro-state                         |

**** Special Buffers
Unlike vim, emacs creates many buffers that most people do not need to see. Some
examples are =*Messages*= and =*Compile-Log*=. Spacemacs tries to automatically
ignore buffers that are not useful. However, you may want to change the way
Spacemacs marks buffers as useful. For instructions, see the [[file:FAQ.org::Change%20special%20buffer%20rules?][special buffer howto]].

**** Files manipulations key bindings
Files manipulation commands (start with ~f~):

*** Ido micro-state
Spacemacs defines a [[Micro-states][micro-state]] for =ido=.

Initiate the micro-state with ~M-SPC~ or ~s-M-SPC~ while in an =ido= buffer.

| Key Binding          | Description                         |
|----------------------+-------------------------------------|
| ~M-SPC~ or ~s-M-SPC~ | initiate or leave the micro-state   |

*** NeoTree file tree
Spacemacs provides a quick and simple way to navigate in an unknown project
file tree with [[https://github.com/jaypei/emacs-neotree][NeoTree]].

To toggle the =NeoTree= buffer press ~SPC f t~ or ~SPC p t~ (the latter open
NeoTree with the root set to the projectile project root).

The NeoTree window always has the number =0= so it does not shift the current
number of the other windows. To select the NeoTree window you then use ~SPC 0~.

VCS integration is supported, the file color will change depending on its
current state. With default =spacemacs-dark= theme:
- green: new file
- purple: modified file

**** NeoTree navigation
Navigation is centered on the ~hjkl~ with the hope to provide a fast navigation
experience like in [[http://ranger.nongnu.org/][ranger]]:

| Key Binding  | Description                                                            |
|--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~h~          | collapse expanded directory or go to parent node                       |
| ~H~          | previous sibling                                                       |
| ~j~          | next file or directory                                                 |
| ~J~          | next expanded directory on level down                                  |
| ~k~          | previous file or directory                                             |
| ~K~          | parent directory, when reaching the root change it to parent directory |
| ~l~ or ~RET~ | expand directory                                                       |
| ~L~          | next sibling                                                           |
| ~R~          | make a directory the root directory                                    |

*Note*: The point is automatically set to the first letter of a node for a
smoother experience.

**** Opening files with NeoTree
By default a file is opened in the last active window. It is possible to choose
window number where to open a file by using a numeric argument, for instance ~2
l~ or ~2 RET~ will open the current file in window 2. It is also possible to
open the file in a split window with ~|~ and ~-~:

| Key Binding      | Description                               |
|------------------+-------------------------------------------|
| ~l~ or ~RET~     | open file in last active window           |
| ~# l~ or ~# RET~ | open file in window number =#=            |
| ~¦~              | open file in an vertically split window   |
| ~-~              | open file in an horizontally split window |

**** Other NeoTree key bindings
| Key Binding | Description                     |
|-------------+---------------------------------|
| ~TAB~       | toggle stretching of the buffer |
| ~c~         | create a node                   |
| ~d~         | delete a node                   |
| ~gr~        | refresh                         |
| ~s~         | toggle showing of hidden files  |
| ~q~ or ~fd~ | hide =NeoTree= buffer           |
| ~r~         | rename a node                   |

**** NeoTree mode-line
The mode-line has the following format =[x/y] d (D:a, F:b)= where:
  - =x= is the index of the current selected file or directory
  - =y= the total number of items (file and directory) in the current directory
  - =d= the name of the current directory
  - =a= the number of directories in the current directory
  - =b= the number of files in the current directory

**** NeoTree Source Control Integration
If you would like NeoTree to show source control information, you can use the
setting =neo-vc-integration=. It is a list containing the possible values:

| Setting | Description                                                               |
|---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =face=  | Show information by changing the color of the file/directory name.        |
| =char=  | Show information with a character to the left of the file/directory name. |

The default is =nil= (do not show source control information), which is recommended.

For example,

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq neo-vc-integration 'face)
#+END_SRC

*Note*: At this time, it is not recommended to set this to anything other
than =nil=.  Otherwise, it will become very slow with larger source trees.
See https://github.com/jaypei/emacs-neotree/issues/126 for more information.

**** NeoTree Theme
You can change the NeoTree theme by using the setting =neo-theme=.  Possible
values are:

| Setting   | Description                                                      |
|-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =classic= | Use an icon to display items - only suitable for gui mode.       |
| =ascii=   | The simplest style, it will use =x=, =-= to display fold status. |
| =arrow=   | Use unicode arrows to display fold status.                       |
| =nerd=    | Use the NERDTree indentation mode and arrows.                    |

The default is =classic=.

Use =nerd= if you want it to look most like NERDTree in VIM.  For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq neo-theme 'nerd)
#+END_SRC

*** Bookmarks
Bookmarks can be set anywhere in a file. Bookmarks are persistent. They are very
useful to jump to/open a known project. Spacemacs uses =helm-bookmarks= to
manage them.

Open an =helm= window with the current bookmarks by pressing: ~SPC h b~

Then in the =helm-bookmarks= buffer:

| Key Binding | Description                                  |
|-------------+----------------------------------------------|
| ~C-d~       | delete the selected bookmark                 |
| ~C-e~       | edit the selected bookmark                   |
| ~C-f~       | toggle filename location                     |
| ~C-o~       | open the selected bookmark in another window |

To save a new bookmark, just type the name of the bookmark and press ~RET~.

*** DocView mode
=doc-view-mode= is a built-in major mode to view DVI, PostScript (PS), PDF,
OpenDocument, and Microsoft Office documents.

| Key Binding | Description                              |

| ~gt~        | go to page number                        |
| ~h~         | previous page                            |
| ~H~         | adjust to height                         |

| ~C-u~       | scroll up                                |
| ~C-c C-c~   | toggle display text and image display    |
| ~C-c C-t~   | open new buffer with doc's text contents |

** Auto-saving
*** Frequency of auto-saving
By default auto-saving of files is performed every 300 characters and
every 30 seconds of idle time which can be changed by setting to a
new value the variables =auto-save-inteval= and =auto-save-timeout=
respectively.

*** Location of auto-saved files
Auto-save of modified files can be performed in-place on the original file
itself /or/ in the cache directory (in this case the original file will remain
unsaved). By default Spacemacs auto-save the file in the cache directory.

To modify the location set the variable =dotspacemacs-auto-save-file-location=
to =original= or =cache=.

Local files are auto-saved in a sub-directory called =site= in the =cache=
directory whereas remote files (i.e. files edited over TRAMP) are auto-saved
in a sub-directory called =dist=.

*** Disable auto-save
To disable auto-saving set the variable =dotspacemacs-auto-save-file-location=
to =nil=.

You can toggle auto-save in a buffer by calling the command =auto-save-mode=.

** Searching
*** With an external tool
Spacemacs can be interfaced with different search utilities like:
  - ack
  - grep
  - [[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher][ag]]
  - [[https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher][pt]]

The search commands in Spacemacs are organized under the ~SPC s~ prefix with the
next key is the tool to use and the last key is the scope. For instance ~SPC s a
b~ will search in all opened buffers using =ag=.

If the last key (determining the scope) is uppercase then the current region or
symbol under point is used as default input for the search. For instance ~SPC s
a B~ will search with symbol under point (if there is no active region).

If the tool key is omitted then a default tool will be automatically selected
for the search. This tool corresponds to the first tool found on the system of
the list =dotspacemacs-search-tools=, the default order is =ag=, =pt=, =ack=
then =grep=. For instance ~SPC s b~ will search in the opened buffers using =pt=
if =ag= has not been found on the system.

The tool keys are:

| Tool | Key |
|------+-----|
| ag   | a   |
| grep | g   |
| ack  | k   |
| pt   | t   |

The available scopes and corresponding keys are:

| Scope                      | Key |
|----------------------------+-----|
| opened buffers             | b   |
| files in a given directory | f   |
| current project            | p   |

It is possible to search in the current file by double tapping the second key
of the sequence, for instance ~SPC s a a~ will search in the current
file with =ag=.

*Notes*:
- =ag= and =pt= are optimized to be used in a source control repository but
  they can be used in an arbitrary directory as well.
- It is also possible to search in several directories at once by marking
  them in the helm buffer.

*Beware* if you use =pt=, [[https://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/doc/trunk/embedded/www/tcllib/files/apps/pt.html][TCL parser tools]] also install a command line tool
called =pt=.

*** Persistent highlighting
Spacemacs uses =evil-search-highlight-persist= to keep the searched expression
highlighted until the next search. It is also possible to clear the highlighting
by pressing ~SPC s c~ or executing the ex command =:noh=.

*** Highlight current symbol
Spacemacs supports highlighting of the current symbol on demand (provided by
[[https://github.com/emacsmirror/auto-highlight-symbol][auto-highlight-symbol]] mode) and adds a micro-state to easily navigate and rename
this symbol.

It is also possible to change the range of the navigation on the fly to:
  - buffer
  - function
  - visible area

To initiate the highlighting of the current symbol under point press ~SPC s h~.

Navigation between the highlighted symbols can be done with the commands:

| Key Binding | Description                                                                        |
|-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~/~         | initiate navigation micro-state on current symbol and jump forwards                |
| ~#~         | initiate navigation micro-state on current symbol and jump backwards               |
| ~SPC s e~   | edit all occurrences of the current symbol(/)                                      |
| ~SPC s h~   | highlight the current symbol and all its occurrence within the current range       |
| ~SPC s H~   | go to the last searched occurrence of the last highlighted symbol                  |
| ~SPC t h a~ | toggle automatic highlight of symbol under point after =ahs-idle-interval= seconds |

In 'Spacemacs' highlight symbol micro-state:

| Key Binding   | Description                                                   |
|---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~e~           | edit occurrences (*)                                          |
| ~n~           | go to next occurrence                                         |
| ~N~           | go to previous occurrence                                     |
| ~d~           | go to next definition occurrence                              |
| ~D~           | go to previous definition occurrence                          |
| ~r~           | change range (=function=, =display area=, =whole buffer=)     |
| ~R~           | go to home occurrence (reset position to starting occurrence) |
| Any other key | leave the navigation micro-state                              |

(*) using [[https://github.com/tsdh/iedit][iedit]] or the default implementation
of =auto-highlight-symbol=

The micro-state text in minibuffer display the following information:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <M> [6/11]* press (n/N) to navigate, (e) to edit, (r) to change range or (R)
    for reset
#+END_EXAMPLE

Where =<M> [x/y]*= is:
  - M: the current range mode
  - =<B>=: whole buffer range
  - =<D>=: current display range
  - =<F>=: current function range
  - =x=: the index of the current highlighted occurrence
  - =y=: the total number of occurrences
  - =*=: appears if there is at least one occurrence which is not currently visible.

*** Visual Star
With [[https://github.com/bling/evil-visualstar][evil-visualstar]] you can search for the next occurrence of the current
selection.

It is pretty useful combined with the [[Region selection][expand-region]] bindings.

*Note*: If the current state is not the =visual state= then pressing ~*~ uses
auto-highlight-symbol and its micro-state.

*** Listing symbols by semantic
Use =helm-semantic-or-imenu= command from =Helm= to quickly navigate between the
symbols in a buffer.

To list all the symbols of a buffer press: ~SPC s j~

*** Helm-swoop
This is very similar to =moccur=, it displays a =helm= buffer with all the
occurrences of the word under point. You can then change the search query in
real-time and navigate between them easily.

You can even edit the occurrences directly in the =helm= buffer and apply the
modifications to the buffer.

| Key Binding | Description                    |
|-------------+--------------------------------|
| ~SPC s s~   | execute =helm-swoop=           |
| ~SPC s S~   | execute =helm-multi-swoop=     |
| ~SPC s C-s~ | execute =helm-multi-swoop-all= |

** Editing
*** Paste text
**** Paste Micro-state
The paste micro-state can be enabled by settings the variable
=dotspacemacs-enable-paste-micro-state= to =t=. By default it is disabled.

When the micro-state is enabled, pressing ~p~ again will replace the pasted text
with the previous yanked (copied) text on the kill ring.

For example if you copy =foo= and =bar= then press ~p~ the text =bar= will
be pasted, pressing ~p~ again will replace =bar= with =foo=.

| Key Binding   | Description                                                               |
|---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~p~ or ~P~    | paste the text before or after point and initiate the =paste= micro-state |
| ~p~           | in micro-state: replace paste text with the previously copied one         |
| ~P~           | in micro-state: replace paste text with the next copied one               |
| ~.~           | paste the same text and leave the micro-state                             |
| Any other key | leave the micro-state                                                     |

**** Auto-indent pasted text
By default any pasted text will be auto-indented. To paste text un-indented use
the universal argument.

It is possible to disable the auto-indentation for specific major-modes by
adding a major-mode to the variable =spacemacs-indent-sensitive-modes= in your
=dotspacemacs/user-config= function.

*** Text manipulation commands
Text related commands (start with ~x~):

*** Smartparens Strict mode
[[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][Smartparens]] comes with a strict mode which prevents deletion of parenthesis if
the result is unbalanced.

This mode can be frustrating for novices, this is why it is not enabled by
default.

It is possible to enable it easily for /all programming modes/ with the variable
=dotspacemacs-smartparens-strict-mode= of you =~/.spacemacs=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-smartparens-strict-mode t)
#+END_SRC

*** Zooming
**** Text
The font size of the current buffer can be adjusted with the commands:

| Key Binding   | Description                                                                |
|---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC z x +~   | scale up the font and initiate the font scaling micro-state                |
| ~SPC z x =~   | scale up the font and initiate the font scaling micro-state                |
| ~SPC z x -~   | scale down the font and initiate the font scaling micro-state              |
| ~SPC z x 0~   | reset the font size (no scaling) and initiate the font scaling micro-state |
| ~+~           | increase the font size                                                     |
| ~=~           | increase the font size                                                     |
| ~-~           | decrease the font size                                                     |
| ~0~           | reset the font size                                                        |
| Any other key | leave the font scaling micro-state                                         |

Note that /only/ the text of the current buffer is scaled, the other buffers,
the mode-line and the minibuffer are not affected. To zoom the whole content of
a frame use the =zoom frame= bindings (see next section).

**** Frame
You can zoom in and out the whole content of the frame with the commands:

| Key Binding   | Description                                                             |
|---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC z f +~   | zoom in the frame content and initiate the frame scaling micro-state    |
| ~SPC z f =~   | zoom in the frame content and initiate the frame scaling micro-state    |
| ~SPC z f -~   | zoom out the frame content and initiate the frame scaling micro-state   |
| ~SPC z f 0~   | reset the frame content size and initiate the frame scaling micro-state |
| ~+~           | zoom in                                                                 |
| ~=~           | zoom in                                                                 |
| ~-~           | zoom out                                                                |
| ~0~           | reset zoom                                                              |
| Any other key | leave the zoom frame micro-state                                        |

*** Increase/Decrease numbers
Spacemacs uses [[https://github.com/cofi/evil-numbers][evil-numbers]] to easily increase or increase numbers.

| Key Binding | Description                                                     |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC n +~   | increase the number under point by one and initiate micro-state |
| ~SPC n -~   | decrease the number under point by one and initiate micro-state |

In micro-state:

| Key Binding   | Description                            |
|---------------+----------------------------------------|
| ~+~           | increase the number under point by one |
| ~-~           | decrease the number under point by one |
| Any other key | leave the micro-state                  |

*Tips:* you can increase or decrease a value by more that once by using a prefix
argument (ie. ~10 SPC n +~ will add 10 to the number under point).

*** Spell checking
Spell checking is enabled by including the [[../layers/spell-checking][spell
checking]] layer in your dotfile.

Keybindings are listed in the layer documentation.

*** Region selection
Vi =Visual= modes are all supported by =evil=.

**** Expand-region
Spacemacs adds another =Visual= mode via the [[https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el][expand-region]] mode.

| Key Binding | Description                              |
|-------------+------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC v~     | initiate expand-region mode then...      |
| ~v~         | expand the region by one semantic unit   |
| ~V~         | contract the region by one semantic unit |
| ~r~         | reset the region to initial selection    |
| ~ESC~       | leave expand-region mode                 |

**** Indent text object
With [[https://github.com/cofi/evil-indent-textobject][evil-indent-textobject]] the following action can be performed in =normal
state=:
  - ~ii~ - Inner Indentation: the surrounding textblock with the same indentation
  - ~ai~ - Above and Indentation: ~ii~ + the line above with a different indentation
  - ~aI~ - Above and Indentation+: ~ai~ + the line below with a different indentation

Example (=|= is the point):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(while (not done)
  (messa|ge "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."))
  (1+ 41)
#+END_SRC

-  ~vii~ will select the line with message
-  ~vai~ will select the whole while loop
-  ~vaI~ will select the whole fragment

*** Region narrowing
The displayed text of a buffer can be narrowed with the commands (start with
~n~):

| Key Binding | Description                               |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC n f~   | narrow the buffer to the current function |
| ~SPC n p~   | narrow the buffer to the visible page     |
| ~SPC n r~   | narrow the buffer to the selected text    |
| ~SPC n w~   | widen, i.e show the whole buffer again    |

*** Line formatting
Spacemacs performs =go to the line below point and indent it= with ~SPC j k~.
You may repeat this operation with =evil-repeat= if you need to indent many
lines.

Line formatting commands start with ~j~:

   | Key Binding | Description                                              |
   |-------------+----------------------------------------------------------|
   | ~J~         | join the current line with the next line                 |
   | ~SPC j j~   | same as SPC j k but will split the current line at point |
   | ~SPC J~     | split a quoted string or s-expression in place           |
   | ~SPC j J~   | split a quoted string or s-expression and auto-indent    |
   | ~SPC j k~   | go to next line and indent it using auto-indent rules    |

Used together these key bindings are very powerful to quickly reformat code.

*** Replacing text with iedit
Spacemacs uses the powerful [[https://github.com/tsdh/iedit][iedit]] mode through [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/evil-iedit-state][evil-iedit-state]] to quickly
edit multiple occurrences of a symbol or selection.

=evil-iedit-state= defines two new evil states:
  - =iedit state=
  - =iedit-insert state=

The color code for these states is =red=.

=evil-iedit-state= has also a nice integration with [[https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el][expand-region]] for quick
editing of the currently selected text by pressing ~e~.

**** iedit states key bindings
***** State transitions
| Key Binding | From             | To     |
|-------------+------------------+--------|
| ~SPC s e~   | normal or visual | iedit  |
| ~e~         | expand-region    | iedit  |
| ~ESC~       | iedit            | normal |
| ~C-g~       | iedit            | normal |
| ~fd~        | iedit            | normal |
| ~ESC~       | iedit-insert     | iedit  |
| ~C-g~       | iedit-insert     | normal |
| ~fd~        | iedit-insert     | normal |

To sum-up, in =iedit-insert state= you have to press ESC twice to go back to the
=normal state=. You can also at any time press ~C-g~ or ~fd~ to return to =normal
state=.

*Note*: evil commands which switch to =insert state= will switch in
=iedit-insert state=.

***** In iedit state
=iedit state= inherits from =normal state=, the following key bindings are
specific to =iedit state=.

| Key Binding | Description                                                                             |

*Note*: ~0~, ~$~, ~A~ and ~I~ have the default Vim behavior when used outside of
an ~occurrence~.

***** In iedit-insert state
| Key Binding | Description               |
|-------------+---------------------------|
| ~ESC~       | go back to =iedit state=  |
| ~C-g~       | go back to =normal state= |

**** Examples
-  manual selection of several words then replace: ~v w w SPC s e S "toto" ESC ESC~
-  append text to a word on two lines: ~v i w SPC s e J i "toto" ESC ESC~
-  substitute symbol /with expand-region/: ~SPC v v e S "toto" ESC ESC~
-  replace symbol with yanked (copied) text /with expand region/: ~SPC v
   e p ESC ESC~

*** Replacing text in several files
Replacing an occurrence of text in several files can be performed via [[https://github.com/syohex/emacs-helm-ag][helm-ag]].

Say you want to replace all =foo= occurrences by =bar= in your current
project:
  - initiate a search with ~SPC /~
  - enter in edit mode with ~C-c C-e~
  - go to the occurrence and enter in =iedit state= with ~SPC s e~
  - edit the occurrences then leave the =iedit state=
  - press ~C-c C-c~

*Note*: In Spacemacs, =helm-ag= despite its name works with =ack= and =pt= as
well.

*** Commenting
Comments are handled by [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/evil-nerd-commenter][evil-nerd-commenter]], it's bound to the following keys.

    | Key Binding | Description               |
    |-------------+---------------------------|
    | ~SPC ;~     | comment operator          |
    | ~SPC c l~   | comment lines             |
    | ~SPC c L~   | invert comment lines      |
    | ~SPC c p~   | comment paragraphs        |
    | ~SPC c P~   | invert comment paragraphs |
    | ~SPC c t~   | comment to line           |
    | ~SPC c T~   | invert comment to line    |
    | ~SPC c y~   | comment and yank          |
    | ~SPC c Y~   | invert comment and yank   |

*Tips:* To comment efficiently a block of line use the combo ~SPC ; SPC y~

*** Deleting files
Deletion is configured to send deleted files to system trash.

On OS X the =trash= program is required. It can be installed with [[http:www.brew.sh][homebrew]] with
the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ brew install trash
#+END_SRC

To disable the trash you can set the variable =delete-by-moving-to-trash= to
=nil= in your =~/.spacemacs=.

*** Editing Lisp code
Editing of lisp code is provided by [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/evil-lisp-state][evil-lisp-state]].

Commands will set the current state to =lisp state= where different commands
combo can be repeated without pressing on ~SPC k~.

When in =lisp state= the color of the mode-line changes to pink.

Examples:
  - to slurp three times while in normal state: ~SPC k 3 s~
  - to wrap a symbol in parenthesis then slurping two times: ~SPC k w 2 s~

*Note*: The =lisp state= commands are available in /any/ modes! Try it out.

** Managing projects
Projects in Spacemacs are managed with [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]]. In =projectile= projects
are defined implicitly, for instance the root of a project is found when a
=.git= repository or =.projectile= file is encountered in the file tree.

=Helm= is used whenever it is possible.

To search in a project see [[Searching in a project][project searching]].

=projectile= commands start with p:

Spacemacs uses [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][Flycheck]] to gives error feedback on the fly. The checks are
only performed at save time by default.

Errors management commands (start with ~e~):

    | Key Binding | Description                                                           |
    |-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ~SPC t s~   | toggle flycheck                                                       |
    | ~SPC e c~   | clear all errors                                                      |
    | ~SPC e h~   | describe a flycheck checker                                           |
    | ~SPC e l~   | toggle the display of the =flycheck= list of errors/warnings          |
    | ~SPC e n~   | go to the next error                                                  |
    | ~SPC e p~   | go to the previous error                                              |
    | ~SPC e v~   | verify flycheck setup (useful to debug 3rd party tools configuration) |

Custom fringe bitmaps:

| Symbol                   | Description |
|--------------------------+-------------|
| [[file:img/dot-error.png]]   | Error       |
| [[file:img/dot-warning.png]] | warning     |
| [[file:img/dot-info.png]]    | Info        |

** Compiling
Spacemacs binds a few commands to support compiling a project.

   | Key Binding | Description                    |
   |-------------+--------------------------------|
   | ~SPC c c~   | use =helm-make= via projectile |
   | ~SPC c C~   | compile                        |
   | ~SPC c k~   | kill compilation               |
   | ~SPC c m~   | =helm-make=                    |
   | ~SPC c r~   | recompile                      |
   | ~SPC c q~   | close compilation window       |

** Modes
*** Major Mode leader key
Key bindings specific to the current =major mode= start with ~SPC m~. For
convenience a shortcut key called the major mode leader key is set by default on
~,~ which saves one precious keystroke.

It is possible to change the major mode leader key by defining the variable
=dotspacemacs-major-mode-leader-key= in your =~/.spacemacs=. For example to
setup the key on tabulation:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-major-mode-leader-key "<tab>")
#+END_SRC

*** Helm
Spacemacs add =hjkl= navigation to =helm= buffers:

    | Key Binding | Description                  |
    |-------------+------------------------------|
    | ~C-h~       | go to next source            |
    | ~C-H~       | describe key (replace ~C-h~) |
    | ~C-j~       | go to previous candidate     |
    | ~C-k~       | go to next candidate         |
    | ~C-l~       | same as ~return~             |

** Emacs Server
Spacemacs starts a server at launch. This server is killed whenever you close
your Emacs windows.

*** Connecting to the Emacs server
You can open a file in Emacs from the terminal using =emacsclient=. Use
=emacsclient -c= to open the file in Emacs GUI. Use =emacsclient -t= to open the
file in Emacs within the terminal.

If you want your Linux/OS X system to use Emacs by default for any prompt, you
need to set it in your shell configuration, e.g. =~/.bashrc= or =~/.zshrc=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh-mode
export EDITOR="emacsclient -c"
#+END_SRC

Note that if you're on OS X, you may have to refer to the emacsclient that comes
with your GUI Emacs, e.g.:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh-mode
export EDITOR="/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient -c"
#+END_SRC

Tip: Remember to use ~:wq~ or ~C-x #~ after you are done editing the file in
Emacs.

See [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html][Emacs as a Server]] in the official Emacs manual for more details.

** Keeping the server alive
It is possible to keep the server alive when you close Emacs by setting the
variable =dotspacemacs-persistent-server= to =t= in your =~./spacemacs=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-persistent-server t)
#+END_SRC

When this variable is set to =t=, the only way to quit Emacs /and/ kill the
server is to use the following bindings:

| Keybinding | Description                                                              |
|------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC q q~  | Quit Emacs and kill the server, prompt for changed buffers to save       |
| ~SPC q Q~  | Quit Emacs and kill the server, lose all unsaved changes.                |
| ~SPC q r~  | Restart both Emacs and the server, prompting to save any changed buffers |
| ~SPC q s~  | Save the buffers, quit Emacs and kill the server                         |
| ~SPC q z~  | Kill the current frame                                                   |

** Troubleshoot
*** Loading fails
If any errors happen during the loading the mode-line will turn red and the
errors should appear inline in the startup buffer. Spacemacs should still be
usable, if it is not the case then restart Emacs with =emacs --debug-init= and
open a [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues][Github issue]] with the backtrace.

*** Upgrading/Downgrading Emacs version
To ensure that packages are correctly compiled for the new Emacs version you
installed, be sure to run the interactive command =spacemacs/recompile-elpa=
with ~SPC : spacemacs/recompile-elpa~.
