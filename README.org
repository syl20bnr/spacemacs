**** *Quick Install*                                            :noexport:

This assumes you don't have an existing Emacs setup and want to run Spacemacs as
your config. If you do have one, look at the [[#install][full installation instructions]] for
other options.

- Linux / MacOS:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_EXAMPLE

- Windows Command Prompt:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs %appdata%/.emacs.d
#+END_EXAMPLE

- Windows PowerShell:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE powershell
  git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs $env:appdata/.emacs.d
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Introduction
Spacemacs is a new way of experiencing Emacs -- it's a sophisticated and
polished set-up, focused on ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency.

Just clone and launch it, then press the space bar to explore the interactive
list of carefully-chosen key bindings. You can also press the home buffer's =[?]=
button for some great first key bindings to try.

Spacemacs can be used naturally by both Emacs and Vim users -- you can even mix
the two editing styles. Being able to quickly switch between input styles, makes
Spacemacs a great tool for pair-programming.

Spacemacs is currently in beta, and any contributions are very welcome.

#+CAPTION: spacemacs_python
[[file:doc/img/spacemacs-python.png]]

* Features

- *Great documentation:* access the Spacemacs documentation with ~SPC h SPC~.
- *Beautiful GUI:* you'll love the distraction free UI and its functional
  mode-line.
- *Excellent ergonomics:* all the key bindings are accessible by pressing the
  space bar or ~Alt-m~.
- *Mnemonic key bindings:* commands have mnemonic prefixes like ~SPC b~ for all
  the buffer commands or ~SPC p~ for the project commands.
- *Batteries included:* discover hundreds of ready-to-use packages nicely
  organised in configuration layers following a set of [[SpaceDevCons][conventions]].

* Documentation
Comprehensive documentation is available for each layer by pressing ~SPC h SPC~.

You can also check the [[SpaceDevDocs][general documentation]], [[SpaceDevGuide][quick start guide]] and the [[SpaceDevFAQ][FAQ]].

* Getting Help
If you need help, ask your question in the [[SpacemacsGitter][Gitter Chat]] and a member of the
community will help you out.

If you prefer IRC, connect to the [[IRCGitter][Gitter Chat IRC server]] and join the
=#syl20bnr/spacemacs= channel.

Last but not least there are a lot of high class tutorials available on YouTube:
- Jack of Some's Spacemacs related channel [[JackOfSomeYouTube][here]]
- GDQuest's Game Design oriented tutorials to Spacemacs [[GDQuestYouTube][here]]
- Practicalli's Clojure tutorials based on Spacemacs [[PracticalliYouTube][here]]
- Eivind Fonn's classic Spacemacs ABC: [[EivindFonnYouTube][here]]
  
* Prerequisites
Spacemacs is an extension of a popular text editor called Emacs. Thus you need
to first install base Emacs and then download the Spacemacs extension files with
Git.

** Emacs
Spacemacs requires Emacs 27.1 or above. The development version of Emacs is not
/officially/ supported, but it should nevertheless be expected to work.

Some modes require third-party tools that you'll have to install via your
favorite package manager.

*** Linux distros
Install the =emacs= package with your Linux distribution's package manager.

Emacs has graphical support.

**** Ubuntu/Debian & derivatives
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sudo apt install emacs
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Fedora/REHL & derivatives
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sudo yum install emacs
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Arch & derivatives
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sudo pacman -S emacs
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** *Note:*
*/Do not/* install the =xemacs= package. It's not supported by Spacemacs. XEmacs is
an old fork of Emacs. The X in its name is unrelated to X11.

Some Linux distributions support only Emacs versions older than 27.1. If this
is the case, you should [[BuildFromSourceManual][build from source]] instead.
  
*** macOS
**** Using emacs-plus
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus

  # to install Emacs 27
  brew install emacs-plus@27 --with-spacemacs-icon
  # or to install Emacs 28
  brew install emacs-plus@28 --with-spacemacs-icon

  brew link emacs-plus
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Using emacs-mac
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
  brew install emacs-mac
  brew link emacs-mac
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Using cask
Homebrew now recommends to use the cask version with the following message:
"Please try the Cask for a better-supported Cocoa version". To install the cask
version:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  brew install --cask emacs
#+END_EXAMPLE

This installs a pre-built package from https://emacsformacosx.com/

**** Other ways
If you're not comfortable with the ways mentioned above, then [[MacosxInstallEmacs][EmacsWiki]] lists
down a few ways to install Emacs for macOS.

*** Windows
Download the official 64-bit (x86_64) stable builds from the [[WindowsInstallEmacs][GNU FTP]].

You'll also need =gzip= in your PATH. Download it from the [[WindowsInstallGzip][GNUWin32 project page]].

** Fonts
The default font used in Spacemacs is Source Code Pro. If you wish to use
Spacemacs 'out of the box', this font needs to be installed. You are free to
change the font in the configurations after installation if you do not wish to
do so.

*** Linux distros
Install the font family with your Linux distribution's package manager. If it is
not available, download the fonts either from the [[SourceCodeProGithub][GitHub repository]] or [[SourceCodeProGoogle][Google
Fonts]] and unzip the contents to =~/.local/share/fonts=. Run the following in a
terminal to install the fonts:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  fc-cache -fv ~/.local/share/fonts
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** macOS
The font family can be installed through brew:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
  brew install --cask font-source-code-pro
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Windows
Download the fonts either from the [[SourceCodeProGithub][GitHub repository]] or [[SourceCodeProGoogle][Google Fonts]] and unzip
the contents to install.

* Install
** Default installation
*** Linux/MacOS
Emacs can search for the configuration in 2 places -- =~/.emacs.d= or
=$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/emacs=. The latter is =~/.config/emacs= on most distributions.

Change the directory in the following code snippets where necessary.

1. If you have an existing Emacs configuration, back it up first by running the
   following code in your terminal:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak
  mv ~/.emacs ~/.emacs.bak
#+END_EXAMPLE

   It is important to /remove/ the =~/.emacs= file as Spacemacs *WILL NOT* be able to
   load otherwise. This is because that file will prevent Emacs from loading
   from the proper initialization file.

2. Clone the repository with [[GitDownload][Git]]:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_EXAMPLE

   Or in case you have a limited internet connection or speed,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_EXAMPLE

3. Launch Emacs. Spacemacs will automatically install the packages it
   requires.

4. Once the packages are installed, answer the questions in the Dotfile wizard
   installer. If you are new to Emacs and Spacemacs, then it's fine to just
   accept the default choices. It's easy to try the other choices later, without
   having to reinstall Spacemacs. They can be changed in the dotfile
   =~/.spacemacs=, accessible from  ~SPC f e d~.

5. After answering the questions, Spacemacs will download and install the
   remaining packages it will require. When the all the packages have been
   installed, restart Emacs to complete the installation.

*** Windows
By default, Emacs looks for the =.emacs.d= directory in
=C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming=, aliased as =%appdata%= in a Windows Command
Prompt shell and =$env:appdata= in a Windows PowerShell Prompt shell. You can also
point it to use the user directory =C:\Users\<username>= by setting a =HOME=
environment variable, aliased as =%$homepath%= in a Windows Command Prompt shell
and =$home= in a Windows PowerShell Prompt shell.

Change the directory in the following code snippets where necessary.

1. If you have an existing Emacs configuration, back it up first.

   Don't forget to backup and /remove/ the =.emacs= file. Otherwise Spacemacs *WILL
   NOT* be able to load. This is because that file will prevent Emacs from
   loading the proper initialization file.

2. Clone the repository with [[GitDownload][Git]]:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs %appdata%/.emacs.d
#+END_EXAMPLE

   Or in case you have a limited internet connection or speed,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs %appdata%/.emacs.d
#+END_EXAMPLE

3. Launch Emacs. Spacemacs will automatically install the packages it
   requires.

4. Once the packages are installed, answer the questions in the Dotfile wizard
   installer. If you are new to Emacs and Spacemacs, then it's fine to just
   accept the default choices. It's easy to try the other choices later, without
   having to reinstall Spacemacs. They can be changed in the dotfile
   =~/.spacemacs=, accessible from  ~SPC f e d~.

5. After answering the questions, Spacemacs will download and install the
   remaining packages it will require. When the all the packages have been
   installed, restart Emacs to complete the installation.

** Alternative installations
There are two alternative methods to install Spacemacs.

*** Modify HOME environment variable in Linux/MacOS
This solution is ideal for quickly trying Spacemacs without compromising your
existing configuration. Clone Spacemacs outside the Emacs dotdirectory
=~/.emacs.d= and modify the HOME environment variable.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  mkdir ~/spacemacs
  git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs.git ~/spacemacs/.emacs.d
  HOME=~/spacemacs emacs
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Note*: If you're using the Fish shell, then you'll need to modify the last
command to: =env HOME=$HOME/spacemacs Emacs=

*** Modify spacemacs-start-directory variable
This solution is better suited to "embed" Spacemacs into your own configuration.
If you've cloned Spacemacs into =~/.emacs.d/spacemacs/=, then drop the following
lines in the =~/.emacs.d/init.el= file:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE elisp
  (setq spacemacs-start-directory "~/.emacs.d/spacemacs/")
  (load-file (concat spacemacs-start-directory "init.el"))
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Post-installation

** Errors

*** Failing to install Emacs packages
Depending on the installed version of GnuTLS or a firewall setting, securely
installing Emacs packages may fail. You can try to disable the HTTPS protocol by
starting Emacs insecurely:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  emacs --insecure
#+END_EXAMPLE

It should be noted that that this should only be done as a *last resort*, at your
own risk, because the packages will be downloaded using the insecure HTTP
protocol.

You can set the =dotspacemacs-elpa-https= variable to =nil= in your dotfile
=~/.spacemacs= but this has the same security implications as the insecure flag.
You may also want to clear out your =.emacs.d/elpa= directory before doing this,
so that any corrupted packages you may have downloaded will be re-installed.

*** error: Package 'package-build-' is unavailable
This error may occur due to heavy network traffic. You can fix it by increasing the
=dotspacemacs-elpa-timeout= variable to a large number like =70= in your dotfile
=~/.spacemacs=.

*** =Warning (bytecomp)= warnings
=Warning (bytecomp)= and other compilation warnings are perfectly normal. If
you're curious, you can find out why these occur [[QuelpaBytecompWarning][here]].

*** Mode-line turns red
If the mode-line turns red, then be sure to consult the [[SpaceDevFAQ][FAQ]].

*** Mode-line looks different from the sample
It's recommended to install [[SourceCodeProGithub][Source Code Pro]] by Adobe as the default font. It
ensures that, for example, the symbols on the mode-line (bottom bar) looks
correct. It's also recommended to use a "Fallback font". These depend on the
system:

- GNU/Linux: /NanumGothic/ (package named /fonts-nanum/ on Debian,
  for example)
- macOS: /Arial Unicode MS/
- Windows: /MS Gothic/ or /Lucida Sans Unicode/

If the mode-line doesn't look similar to the [[#introduction][picture at the top of this page]],
make sure you have the correct fallback font installed.

If you're running in a terminal, then you'll also need to change the
terminal's font settings.

*** "The directory of =~/.emacs.d/server= is unsafe"
If the above error is displayed after starting Emacs, you can fix it by changing
the owner of the directory.

- From Properties select the Tab "Security",
- Select the button "Advanced",
- Select the Tab "Owner"
- Change the owner to your account name

** Goodies
*** Linux
**** .desktop file
Create =spacemacs.desktop= in =~/.local/share/applications/=
using [[LinuxSpacemacsDesktopFile][this .desktop file]] as a reference.

Change the =Name= parameter to =Name=Spacemacs= and the =Icon= parameter to
=Icon=/PATH/TO/EMACSD/core/banners/img/spacemacs.png= where =PATH/TO/EMACSD= is the
path to your =.emacs.d= directory described in [[*Linux/MacOS][the install section]], usually =~/.emacs.d= or =~/.config/emacs.=

*** MacOS

**** Changing the app logo
You need to [[SpacemacsLogoIcon][download the .icns version of the logo]] and simply [[MacosxChangeIcon][change the logo on
the Dock]].

**** osx layer
It's also recommended to add the [[SpaceDevLayersOSX][osx layer]] to your [[SpaceDevDotfile][dotfile]] after completing the
Spacemacs [[#install][install process]]. Instructions on how to do so are available in the
documentation for the [[SpaceDevLayersOSX][osx layer]].

**** Improving searches
You may also have some issues when searching for your projects. It is
recommended to install the GNU [[RipgrepHomebrew][ripgrep]] through homebrew:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  brew install ripgrep
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Windows

**** Improving searches 
For efficient searches, we recommend installing [[RipgrepGithub][ripgrep]].

**** Viewing hidden files/folders
The period (dot) before a file or folder name means that it's a hidden file or
folder. To show hidden files and folders:

- Press the Windows key
- Type =File explorer options=
- Select the =View= tab at the top
- Check =Show hidden files, folders and drives=
- Click =OK=
