* Release 0.102.x (in progress)
** 0.102.0 (2015/05/31)
*** Breaking changes
- Key binding to reload the dotfile is now =SPC f e R= instead of
  =C-c C-c= or =SPC m c c=. Note that =SPC f e R= can be triggered
  anywhere (it is not restricted to the doftile anymore).
- Key binding to switch buffer is now =SPC b b= instead of =SPC b s=.
- =SPC f f= now uses =helm-find-files= instead of =ido=, use the new
  layer =ido= to get the old =SPC f f= behavior back.
- Helm =TAB= and =C-z= key bindings have been *swapped*.
*** New Layers

*** Dotfile changes
- New variable =dotspacemacs-search-tools= which is a list of search tool
  executable names. Spacemacs uses the first installed tool of the list
  with search related key bindings (=SPC /=, =SPC s ...=).
  Supported tools are `ag', `pt', `ack' and `grep'."
- New variable =dotspacemacs-highlight-delimiters= which selects a scope
  to highlight delimiters. Possible value is =all=, =current= or =nil=.
  Default is =all=. (thanks to tuhdo)
- New variable =dotspacemacs-additional-packages=. Adding packages to
  this list will install them without needing them to be wrapped in a
  layer. Ideal for quickly add a package. The package configuration
  can be put in =dotspacemas/config=.
*** Layer changes

* Release 0.101.x (2015/04/13)
** Hot new features
*** Choose your own editing style
Thanks to the new =holy-mode= Spacemacs can now  be used by Vim users
or Emacs users by setting the =dotspacemacs-editing-style= variable to
='vim= or ='emacs= in the dotfile. In =Emacs= style the leader is
available on =M-m=. It is possible to dynamically switch between the
two style with =SPC P tab=.
*** Mandatory init function and new Pre and Post init functions
A package is now considered to be used only if there is a corresponding
=<layer>/init-<package>= function explicitly defined.
There is now two new functions to initialize a given package:
- =<layer>/pre-init-<package>= which is called before the init function
- =<layer>/post-init-<package>= which is called after the init function
Even if  a =pre= or =post= function exist for a given package, an =init=
function is still required to consider the package to be used.
*** Auto-completion
Spacemacs now officially support auto-completion. The old layer
=company-mode= has been removed and =auto-complete= has been removed
from the spacemacs layer.
They are now part of a new layer called =auto-completion=.
You'll have to this add layer to your dotfile to enable auto-completion.
*** Syntax checking
Flycheck has been removed from the Spacemacs layer and moved to a new
layer called =syntax-checking=.
You'll have to add this layer to your dotfile to enable the fly syntax
checking.
*** Org
Org packages have been removed from Spacemacs layer and moved to a new
=org= layer.
You'll have to add this layer to your dotfile to enable the Org
configuration of Spacemacs.
*** New shortcuts in startup buffer
Recent files, project and bookmarks can be displayed on the startup
buffer. Check for the new dotfile variable =dotspacemacs-startup-lists=.
(thanks to CarlQLange)
*** New lighter in the mode line
Lighter letters have been updated, now the letter corresponds to the
key binding to toggle the associated mode. For instance auto-completion
is on ‚ìê and thus can be toggled with =SPC t a=.
*** Better package update
The package update should now prevent even more errors when upgrading
a batch of packages.
** Initial Release
