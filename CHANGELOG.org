  Users on =develop= branch cannot use this function.

  for confirmation before updating.

  with the variable =latex-nofill-env= (thanks to JP-Ellis)

*** IMPORTANT: Breaking changes
- All Emacs Lisp related configuration has been moved to its own layer
  called =emacs-lisp=, be sure to add this layer to your dotfile.
- All shell related configuration has been move to its own layer called
  =shell=, be sure to add this layer to your dotfile if you use a shell
  inside Emacs.
- Key binding to reload the dotfile is now =SPC f e R= instead of
  =C-c C-c= or =SPC m c c=. Note that =SPC f e R= can be triggered
  anywhere (it is not restricted to the doftile anymore).

* Release 0.101.x
** Hot new features
*** Choose your own editing style
Thanks to the new =holy-mode= Spacemacs can now  be used by Vim users
or Emacs users by setting the =dotspacemacs-editing-style= variable to
='vim= or ='emacs= in the dotfile. In =Emacs= style the leader is
available on =M-m=. It is possible to dynamically switch between the
two style with =SPC P tab=.
*** Mandatory init function and new Pre and Post init functions
A package is now considered to be used only if there is a corresponding
=<layer>/init-<package>= function explicitly defined.
There is now two new functions to initialize a given package:
- =<layer>/pre-init-<package>= which is called before the init function
- =<layer>/post-init-<package>= which is called after the init function
Even if  a =pre= or =post= function exist for a given package, an =init=
function is still required to consider the package to be used.
*** Auto-completion
Spacemacs now officially support auto-completion. The old layer
=company-mode= has been removed and =auto-complete= has been removed
from the spacemacs layer.
They are now part of a new layer called =auto-completion=.
You'll have to this add layer to your dotfile to enable auto-completion.
*** Syntax checking
Flycheck has been removed from the Spacemacs layer and moved to a new
layer called =syntax-checking=.
You'll have to add this layer to your dotfile to enable the fly syntax
checking.
*** Org
Org packages have been removed from Spacemacs layer and moved to a new
=org= layer.
You'll have to add this layer to your dotfile to enable the Org
configuration of Spacemacs.
*** New shortcuts in startup buffer
Recent files, project and bookmarks can be displayed on the startup
buffer. Check for the new dotfile variable =dotspacemacs-startup-lists=.
(thanks to CarlQLange)
*** New lighter in the mode line
Lighter letters have been updated, now the letter corresponds to the
key binding to toggle the associated mode. For instance auto-completion
is on ⓐ and thus can be toggled with =SPC t a=.
*** Better package update
The package update should now prevent even more errors when upgrading
a batch of packages.
** Initial Release (2015/04/13)
*** New layers
- evil-commentary: Alternative to =evil-nerd-commenter=
  (thanks to person808)

  rather empty for now. (thanks to tuhdo)
- ERC: an IRC client (thanks to swaroopch)

- xkcd: browse for XKCD in Emacs (thanks to CestDiego)
- shell-scripts: layer containing shell specific modes like =fish-mode=
- editorconfig: add support for EditorConfig (thanks to jupl)
*** New dotfile variables:
- =dotspacemacs-editing-style= can be either =vim= or =emacs=.
- =dotspacemacs-verbose-loading= if non nil the loading prints logs in
  the =*Messages*= buffer. Default value is =nil=.
- =dotspacemacs-startup-lists= is a list of symbols to display recent
  items in the startup buffer, possible values are:  =recents=,
  =bookmarks= and =projects= (thanks to CarlQLange)
*** Auto-complete
