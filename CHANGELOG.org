* Releases 0.101.x (2015/04/13)
** Hot new features
*** Choose your own editing style
Thanks to the new `holy-mode` Spacemacs can now  be used by Vim users
or Emacs users by setting the `dotspacemacs-editing-style` variable to
`'vim` or `'emacs` in the dotfile. In `Emacs` style the leader is
available on `M-m`. It is possible to dynamically switch between the
two style with `SPC P tab`.
*** Mandatory init function and new Pre and Post init functions
A package is now considered to be used only if there is a corresponding
`<layer>/init-<package>` function explicitly defined.
There is now two new functions to initialize a given package:
- `<layer>/pre-init-<package>` which is called before the init function
- `<layer>/post-init-<package>` which is called after the init function
Even if  a `pre` or `post` function exist for a given package, an `init`
function is still required to consider the package to be used.
*** Auto-completion
Spacemacs now officially support auto-completion. The old layer
`company-mode` has been removed and `auto-complete` has been removed
from the spacemacs layer.
They are now part of a new layer called `auto-completion`.
You'll have to this layer to your dotfile to enable auto-completion.
*** Syntax checking
Flycheck has been removed from the Spacemacs layer and moved to a new
layer called `syntax-checking`.
You'll have to this layer to your dotfile to enable on the fly syntax
checking.
*** Org
Org packages have been removed from Spacemacs layer and moved to a new
`org` layer.
You'll have to this layer to your dotfile to enable the Org
configuration of Spacemacs.
*** New shortcuts in startup buffer
Recent files, project and bookmarks can be displayed on the startup
buffer. Check for the new dotfile variable `dotspacemacs-startup-lists`.
(thanks to CarlQLange)
*** New lighter in the mode line
Lighter letters have been updated, now the letter corresponds to the
key binding to toggle the associated mode. For instance auto-completion
is on ⓐ and thus can be toggled with `SPC t a`.
*** Better package update
The package update should now prevent even more errors when upgrading
a batch of packages.
