** 0.200.0 (2016/10/02)
*** IMPORTANT: Breaking changes
- The support for Emacs 24.3 has been dropped, Spacemacs needs at least Emacs
  24.4 to work correctly.
- =extensions= are deprecated as announced in previous release, if you still
  have =extensions= directories you must rename them to =local= and move
  the contents of the =extensions.el= files to the =packages.el= files adding
  the keyword =:location local= to them in the package list. Refer to other
  layers for examples (for instance the =python= layer)
- =<package>-excluded-packages= variables are now deprecated as announced in
  previous release, you must now use the keyword =:excluded t= of the package
  list, see the =vim-empty-lines= layer for example.
- Key binding ~SPC :~ acting as =M-x= as been replaced by ~SPC SPC~.
  If you want to revert to the old ~SPC :~ key binding set the new
  variable =dotspacemacs-emacs-command-key= to ":".
- Key binding ~SPC f e h~ is now ~SPC h SPC~
- Key bindings to delete things are now more consistent and use the ~d~ key.
  We moved ~SPC w c~ and ~SPC w C~ to ~SPC w d~ and ~SPC w D~.
- Refactor ~SPC w~ and ~SPC b~ regarding deletion to clean redundant actions
  and bring more consistency between the two prefixes (see
  =Distribution layer changes= section in change log for more information)
- ~SPC j~ prefix has been modified to include =jump= commands:
  - =avy= commands are now behind the prefix ~SPC j~ for =jump=:
    - ~SPC j j~ to jump to a character in the buffer (works as an evil motion)
    - ~SPC j l~ to jump to a line with avy (works as an evil motion)
    - ~SPC j w~ to jump to a word in the current buffer (works as an evil motion)
  - the following key bindings have been moved:
    - ~SPC j j~ to split a line has been moved to ~SPC j n~
    - ~SPC j h~ and ~SPC j l~ have been moved to ~SPC j 0~ and ~SPC j $~
      respectively.
    - ~SPC J~ to split a string or sexp has been moved to ~SPC j s~
- All helm related key bindings under ~SPC h~ that are not about help have
  been moved to different key bindings:
  - ~SPC h b~ for =helm-filtered-bookmarks~is now ~SPC f b~
  - ~SPC h l~ for =helm-resume= is now ~SPC r l~
  - ~SPC h L~ for =helm-locate-library= is now ~SPC f e l~
- Change default value of =dotspacemacs-remap-Y-to-y$= to =nil=
- Git key bindings under ~SPC g~ have been reorganised to free up some keys
  and capitalize on =Magit= dispatch menu to keep things consistent (see
  =git= section in change log for more information)
- Spacemacs layouts scope has been changed, now ~SPC b b~ lists the buffers of
  the current layout, use ~SPC B b~ to list all the opened buffers.
- =org-indent= is now turned off by default
- Micro states are now called transient states, the macro
  =spacemacs|define-micro-state= is deprecated, it is replaced by the new
  =hydra= powered macro =spacemacs|define-transient-state=.
- Spacemacs layouts and workspaces transient states now exit when a layout or
  workspace is selected, use ~C-0~ ... ~C-9~ to switch to a layout and keep
  the transient state open.
- Remove support for the value =all= for =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers=
  variable. To install all the packages supported by Spacemacs there is a new
  variable =dotspacemacs-install-packages=.
- Remove layer variable  =colors-enable-rainbow-identifiers= in =colors= layer,
  You have to replace it by =colors-colorize-identifiers 'all=.
- The =bépo= layer has been replaced by the new layer =keyboard-layout=, see the
  =README.org= of the layer for more info.
*** Hot new features
- Refactor of the layer system which should reduce startup time by 20~25%.
- New option to lazy install layers based on =auto-mode-alist= (similar to
  =Prelude= lazy install of packages but for layers) via the variable
  =dotspacemacs-enable-lazy-installation=.
- Add support for Ivy via the new layer =ivy=, when used it replaces =helm=
  (thanks to justbur, d12frosted, goofansu, lszekeres, nixmaniack, ralesi,
  TheBB, zilongshanren)
- Add support for different keyboard layouts via the new layer
  =keyboard-layout=, currently supported layouts are =bépo= and =dvorak=
  (thanks to StreakyCobra)
- New transient states powered by =Hydra=, they replace the deprecated
  micro states (thanks to justbur)
- New =jump to definition= abstraction to handle multiple jump backends like
  tags, dumb-jump etc... (thanks to TheBB)
- Global access to all available REPLs with ~SPC a '~ and `SPC m '~ (thanks to
  AlejandroCatalina and TheBB)
- New debugging tools:
  - press ~SPC q d~ to restart Emacs in debug mode with command line parameter
  =--debug-init=
  - press ~SPC q D~ to restart Emacs without Spacemacs but with a list of
  selected packages to load.
  (thanks to StreakyCobra)
- New way to install all the supported packages by Spacemacs via the variable
  =dotspacemacs-install-packages=
- Improved =emacs= and =hybrid= editing styles to fix configuration
  inconsistencies
- the =spacemacs= layer has been split into multiple layers to allow better
  modularity (these layers are in =+spacemacs= sub-directory):
  - spacemacs-completion
  - spacemacs-editing
  - spacemacs-editing-visual
  - spacemacs-evil
  - spacemacs-language
  - spacemacs-layouts
  - spacemacs-misc
  - spacemacs-org
  - spacemacs-ui

*** Dotfile changes
**** Changes for variable values and keywords
- Add new keyword =:packages= for the list of layers in variable
  =dotspacemacs-configuration-layer=, =:packages= allow to select or exclude
  packages from a layer.
- Add new keyword =:enabled-for= for the list of layers in variable
  =dotspacemacs-configuration-layer=, this keyword controls the effect of a
  layer on the other layers. For instance one can enable the =auto-completion=
  only for the =python= layer with the value
  =(auto-completion :enabled-for python)=
  Note that this keyword is the opposite of the existing keyword
  =:disabled-for=. (thanks to TheBB)
- The value of =dotspacemacs-editing-style= can now be a list containing the
  keyword =:variables= (similar to =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers=) to
  define additional variables to modify the behavior of the editing style. This
  new keyword is useful for =hybrid= style which supports these variables:
  - =hybrid-mode-enable-evilified-state=, if non nil then buffer are evilified,
  - =hybrid-mode-enable-hjkl-bindings=, if non nil navigation on ~hjkl~ keys is
    enabled (for instance in =helm= buffers),
  - =hybrid-mode-default-state=, the default state when opening a new buffer,
    by default it is =normal=.
- The value of =dotspacemacs-default-font= can now be a list (thanks to TheBB)
- New supported values for =dotspacemacs-startup-lists=:
  - agenda
  - todos
  (thanks to tonyday567)
- Change default value of =dotspacemacs-remap-Y-to-y$= to =nil=

**** New variables
- New variable =dotspacemacs-enable-lazy-installation= to install a layer only
  when a file with a supported type is opened. Possible values are =all=,
  =unused= and =nil=:
  - =unused= will lazy install only unused layers
  - =all= will lazy install any layer that support lazy installation even the

  packages cannot be updated or rollbacked.
- New variable =dotspacemacs-install-packages= which replaces the variable
  =dotspacemacs-delete-orphan-packages=. This new variable defines the behavior
  of Spacemacs for installed packages.
  Possible values are =used-only=, =used-but-keep-unused= and =all=.

  =dotspacemacs-command-key=. This variable represents the key to press after
  the leader key to execute =M-x=. Default value is ~SPC~.
- New variable =dotspacemacs-folding-method= to allow choosing between
  different code folding methods. Currently supported are =evil= and =origami=.
  Default value is =evil=. (thanks to ralesi)

  the closing parenthesis ~)~ key in insert mode passes over any automatically
  added closing parenthesis, bracket, quote, etc...
  This can be temporary disabled by pressing ~C-q~ before ~)~. Default is nil.
  (thanks to StreakyCobra)
- New variable =dotspacemacs-retain-visual-mode-on-shift=, If non nil ~>~ is

- Refactor ~SPC w~ and ~SPC b~ regarding deletion to clean redundant actions
  and bring more consistency between the two prefixes:
  - ~SPC b k~ has been removed
  - ~SPC b m~ (buffer move) has been removed because the functionality
    is available via ~SPC w~ with ~SPC w h/j/k/l~, ~SPC w H/J/K/L~ and
    ~SPC w M~.
  - ~SPC b K~ (kill other buffers) is now ~SPC b m~ to map with ~SPC w m~
    (kill other window or maximize). Using the universal prefix argument
    ~SPC u SPC b m~ will also kill the windows.
  - ~SPC b C-k~ (kill buffer matching regexp) is now on ~SPC b C-d~
  - ~SPC b D~ now kills a buffer using =ace-window=.

    also delete the window. So ~SPC u SPC b d~ and ~SPC u SPC b D~ delete
    the buffer and the window.
- Command prefix ~SPC j~ is now also for =jumping=, introduced key bindings are:
  - ~SPC j 0~ to go to the beginning of line (and set a mark at the previous
    location in the line)
  - ~SPC j $~ to go to the end of line (and set a mark at the previous location
    in the line)
  - ~SPC j b~ to undo a jump (go back to previous location)
  - ~SPC j d~ to jump to a listing of the current directory
  - ~SPC j D~ to jump to a listing of the current directory (other window)

  - ~SPC j J~ to jump to a suite of two characters in the buffer
    (works as an evil motion)
  - ~SPC j I~ to jump to a definition in any buffer (imenu)
  - ~SPC j k~ to jump to next line and indent it using auto-indent rules
  - ~SPC j l~ to jump to a line with avy (works as an evil motion)
  - ~SPC j n~ to split the current line at point, insert a new line and
     auto-indent
  - ~SPC j s~ to split a quoted string or s-expression in place
  - ~SPC j S~ to split a quoted string or s-expression, insert a new line and
    auto-indent
  - ~SPC j u~ to jump to a URL in the current buffer
  - ~SPC j v~ to jump to the definition/declaration of the variable around point

    at startup
  - rate limit the checks to once per day
  - change default value of variable =dotspacemacs-check-for-update= to =nil=
  - make function =spacemacs/check-for-new-version= interactive so checking
    for a new version can be done on demand.

  symbol or a list. A package is considered to be used if the toggle evaluates
  to non nil. By default =:toggle= is =t=.
- New keyword =:min-version= for package lists =<layer>-packages=. Providing a
  min-version allows to fetch the elpa version of a built-in package.

*** IMPORTANT - Breaking changes
- =org-plus-contrib= is now installed from org ELPA repository, you may
  encounter strange behaviours from Org. In this case delete the =org= directory
  in the =elpa= directory and restart Emacs.
- =Helm= key bindings have been slightly adjusted:
  - in =helm-find-files= (~SPC f f~): now ~C-h~ move up a directory and ~C-l~
    enter the selected directory. =describe-key= command is available on ~C-S-h~
  - in other =helm= buffers ~C-h~ is used to go to the next source and ~C-l~
     is the same as ~RET~. =describe-key= command is also available on ~C-S-h~.
- ~Y~ has been remapped to ~y$~
- The =bookmark= saved file has been moved to the =.cache= directory, if
  you have a bookmark file =~/.emacs.d/bookmarks= then you'll have to move it
  to =~/.emacs.d/.cache/bookmarks=
- =Ruby on Rails= framework has now its own layer called =ruby-on-rails=,
  be sure to add this layer to your dotfile if you use RoR.
- =Django= framework has now its own layer called =django=,
  be sure to add this layer to your dotfile if you use it.
- =guide-key= has been replaced by =which-key=, you may encounter issues
  if you have some =guide-key= custom configuration, remove any =guide-key=
  configuration and check the options offered by =which-key=.
*** Other important notes
- All layers have been moved to =layers= directory
- Category folder prefix has been changed to =+= (was =!=)
- =spacemacs= layer has been moved to the =layers= directory in the
  category =+distribution=
- All =extensions= directories have been renamed to =local=. =extensions=
  directories will be deprecated in 0.105.0.
- =tromey= ELPA repository has been removed (thanks to robbyoconnor)
*** Hot new features
- Enhanced layer package lists which merge old extension lists and package
  lists. Keywords can be associated with packages. The supported keywords
  are =:location=, =:step= and =:excluded=.
  =extensions.el= files and =<layer>-excluded-packages= variables are now
  optional and will be deprecated in the next version 0.105.0.
- New =distribution= concept: you can now choose between two distributions:
  =spacemacs= or =spacemacs-base=. =spacemacs-base= contains only
  a minimal set of packages whereas =spacemacs= is the full Spacemacs
  experience. Set the distribution with =dotspacemacs-distribution= variable.
- Add support for =Quelpa= which allows to use =Melpa= recipes to install
  packages directly from source (i.e. one can now install a package directly
  from a Github repository).
- New editing style: =hybrid=. This style is similar to Vim style except that
  all Emacs key bindings are available in hybrid (insert) state instead of Vim
  key bindings. Also in this state, the buffers are evilified like in Vim style.
- The default theme of Spacemacs is now =spacemacs-dark=. The Spacemacs themes
  (=spacemacs-dark= and =spacemacs-light=) become the official themes of
  Spacemacs (thanks to nashamri)
- Recovery mode when there is an error in the user dotfile. Now even when your
  dotfile cannot be loaded, Spacemacs will be operational with a minimal set
  of packages available (thanks to cmccloud)
- Add support for dotdirectory =~/.spacemacs.d= which behaves like the Emacs
  dotdirectory (i.e. =~/.spacemacs.d/init.el= is evaluated instead of
  =~/.spacemacs= if the former exists and the latter does not) (thanks to
  justbur)
- Guide-key is replaced by =which-key= which provides an enhanced and better
  live key bindings browsing experience. (thanks to justbur)
- New API to manage the =powerline= mode-line. It is now possible to easily
  define segments and arrange them (thanks to TheBB)
- New web gallery to browse themes in =themes-megapack=, URL: [[http://themegallery.robdor.com][theme gallery
 ]] (thanks to robmerrell)
- New test framework supporting layer specific tests (thanks to TheBB)
- New interactive function =dotspacemacs/test-dotfile= testing the integrity
  of the =.spacemacs= file. This function will detect any unknown layers and
  bad dotspacemacs variable values (thanks to justbur)
*** New conventions

*** IMPORTANT: Breaking changes
- All Emacs Lisp related configuration has been moved to its own layer
  called =emacs-lisp=, be sure to add this layer to your dotfile.
- All shell related configuration has been move to its own layer called
  =shell=, be sure to add this layer to your dotfile if you use a shell
  inside Emacs.

* Release 0.101.x
** Hot new features
*** Choose your own editing style
Thanks to the new =holy-mode= Spacemacs can now  be used by Vim users
or Emacs users by setting the =dotspacemacs-editing-style= variable to
='vim= or ='emacs= in the dotfile. In =Emacs= style the leader is
available on =M-m=. It is possible to dynamically switch between the
two style with ~SPC P tab~.
*** Mandatory init function and new Pre and Post init functions
A package is now considered to be used only if there is a corresponding
=<layer>/init-<package>= function explicitly defined.
There is now two new functions to initialize a given package:
- =<layer>/pre-init-<package>= which is called before the init function
- =<layer>/post-init-<package>= which is called after the init function
Even if  a =pre= or =post= function exist for a given package, an =init=
function is still required to consider the package to be used.
*** Auto-completion
Spacemacs now officially support auto-completion. The old layer
=company-mode= has been removed and =auto-complete= has been removed
from the spacemacs layer.
They are now part of a new layer called =auto-completion=.
You'll have to this add layer to your dotfile to enable auto-completion.
*** Syntax checking
Flycheck has been removed from the Spacemacs layer and moved to a new
layer called =syntax-checking=.
You'll have to add this layer to your dotfile to enable the fly syntax
checking.
*** Org
Org packages have been removed from Spacemacs layer and moved to a new
=org= layer.
You'll have to add this layer to your dotfile to enable the Org
configuration of Spacemacs.
*** New shortcuts in startup buffer
Recent files, project and bookmarks can be displayed on the startup
buffer. Check for the new dotfile variable =dotspacemacs-startup-lists=.
(thanks to CarlQLange)
*** New lighter in the mode line
Lighter letters have been updated, now the letter corresponds to the
key binding to toggle the associated mode. For instance auto-completion
is on ⓐ and thus can be toggled with ~SPC t a~.
*** Better package update
The package update should now prevent even more errors when upgrading
a batch of packages.
