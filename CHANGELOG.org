** 0.200.0 (2016/10/02)
*** IMPORTANT: Breaking changes
- The support for Emacs 24.3 has been dropped, Spacemacs needs at least Emacs
  24.4 to work correctly.
- =extensions= are deprecated as announced in previous release, if you still
  have =extensions= directories you must rename them to =local= and move
  the contents of the =extensions.el= files to the =packages.el= files adding
  the keyword =:location local= to them in the package list. Refer to other
  layers for examples (for instance the =python= layer)
- =<package>-excluded-packages= variables are now deprecated as announced in
  previous release, you must now use the keyword =:excluded t= of the package
  list, see the =vim-empty-lines= layer for example.
- Key binding ~SPC :~ acting as =M-x= as been replaced by ~SPC SPC~.
  If you want to revert to the old ~SPC :~ key binding set the new
  variable =dotspacemacs-emacs-command-key= to ":".
- Key binding ~SPC f e h~ is now ~SPC h SPC~
- Key bindings to delete things are now more consistent and use the ~d~ key.
  We moved ~SPC w c~ and ~SPC w C~ to ~SPC w d~ and ~SPC w D~.
- Refactor ~SPC w~ and ~SPC b~ regarding deletion to clean redundant actions
  and bring more consistency between the two prefixes (see
  =Distribution layer changes= section in change log for more information)
- ~SPC j~ prefix has been modified to include =jump= commands:
  - =avy= commands are now behind the prefix ~SPC j~ for =jump=:
    - ~SPC j j~ to jump to a character in the buffer (works as an evil motion)
    - ~SPC j l~ to jump to a line with avy (works as an evil motion)
    - ~SPC j w~ to jump to a word in the current buffer (works as an evil motion)
  - the following key bindings have been moved:
    - ~SPC j j~ to split a line has been moved to ~SPC j n~
    - ~SPC j h~ and ~SPC j l~ have been moved to ~SPC j 0~ and ~SPC j $~
      respectively.
    - ~SPC J~ to split a string or sexp has been moved to ~SPC j s~
- All helm related key bindings under ~SPC h~ that are not about help have
  been moved to different key bindings:
  - ~SPC h b~ for =helm-filtered-bookmarks~is now ~SPC f b~
  - ~SPC h l~ for =helm-resume= is now ~SPC r l~
  - ~SPC h L~ for =helm-locate-library= is now ~SPC f e l~
- Git key bindings under ~SPC g~ have been reorganised to free up some keys
  and capitalize on =Magit= dispatch menu to keep things consistent (see
  =git= section in change log for more information)
- Spacemacs layouts scope has been changed, now ~SPC b b~ lists the buffers of
  the current layout, use ~SPC B b~ to list all the opened buffers.
- =org-indent= is now turned off by default
- Micro states are now called transient states, the macro
  =spacemacs|define-micro-state= is deprecated, it is replaced by the new
  =hydra= powered macro =spacemacs|define-transient-state=.
- Spacemacs layouts and workspaces transient states now exit when a layout or
  workspace is selected, use ~C-0~ ... ~C-9~ to switch to a layout and keep
  the transient state open.
- Remove support for the value =all= for =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers=
  variable. To install all the packages supported by Spacemacs there is a new
  variable =dotspacemacs-install-packages=.
- Remove layer variable  =colors-enable-rainbow-identifiers= in =colors= layer,
  You have to replace it by =colors-colorize-identifiers 'all=.
- The =bépo= layer has been replaced by the new layer =keyboard-layout=, see the
  =README.org= of the layer for more info.
*** Hot new features
- Refactor of the layer system which should reduce startup time by 20~25%.
- New option to lazy install layers based on =auto-mode-alist= (similar to
  =Prelude= lazy install of packages but for layers) via the variable
  =dotspacemacs-enable-lazy-installation=.

  (thanks to justbur, d12frosted, goofansu, lszekeres, nixmaniack, ralesi,
  TheBB, zilongshanren)
- Add support for different keyboard layouts via the new layer
  =keyboard-layout=, currently supported layouts are =bépo= and =dvorak=
  (thanks to StreakyCobra)
- New transient states powered by =Hydra=, they replace the deprecated
  micro states (thanks to justbur)
- New =jump to definition= abstraction to handle multiple jump backends like
  tags, dumb-jump etc... (thanks to TheBB)
- Global access to all available REPLs with ~SPC a '~ and `SPC m '~ (thanks to
  AlejandroCatalina and TheBB)
- New debugging tools:
  - press ~SPC q d~ to restart Emacs in debug mode with command line parameter
  =--debug-init=
  - press ~SPC q D~ to restart Emacs without Spacemacs but with a list of
  selected packages to load.
  (thanks to StreakyCobra)
- New way to install all the supported packages by Spacemacs via the variable
  =dotspacemacs-install-packages=
- Improved =emacs= and =hybrid= editing styles to fix configuration
  inconsistencies
- the =spacemacs= layer has been split into multiple layers to allow better
  modularity (these layers are in =+spacemacs= sub-directory):
  - spacemacs-completion
  - spacemacs-editing
  - spacemacs-editing-visual
  - spacemacs-evil
  - spacemacs-language
  - spacemacs-layouts

- Add new keyword =:packages= for the list of layers in variable
  =dotspacemacs-configuration-layer=, =:packages= allow to select or exclude
  packages from a layer.
- Add new keyword =:enabled-for= for the list of layers in variable
  =dotspacemacs-configuration-layer=, this keyword controls the effect of a
  layer on the other layers. For instance one can enable the =auto-completion=
  only for the =python= layer with the value
  =(auto-completion :enabled-for python)=
  Note that this keyword is the opposite of the existing keyword
  =:disabled-for=. (thanks to TheBB)
- The value of =dotspacemacs-editing-style= can now be a list containing the
  keyword =:variables= (similar to =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers=) to
  define additional variables to modify the behavior of the editing style. This
  new keyword is useful for =hybrid= style which supports these variables:
  - =hybrid-mode-enable-evilified-state=, if non nil then buffer are evilified,
  - =hybrid-mode-enable-hjkl-bindings=, if non nil navigation on ~hjkl~ keys is
    enabled (for instance in =helm= buffers),
  - =hybrid-mode-default-state=, the default state when opening a new buffer,
    by default it is =normal=.
- The value of =dotspacemacs-default-font= can now be a list (thanks to TheBB)
- New supported values for =dotspacemacs-startup-lists=:
  - agenda
  - todos
  (thanks to tonyday567)
- Change default value of =dotspacemacs-startup-lists= to =nil=
- Change default value of =dotspacemacs-check-for-update= to =nil=
- Remove support for value =all= in variable =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers=
- Remove variable =dotspacemacs-startup-recent-list-size= which has been replaced
  by adding support for cons cells in variable =dotspacemacs-startup-list=
  (thanks to ralesi)
**** New variables
- New variable =dotspacemacs-enable-lazy-installation= to install a layer only
  when a file with a supported type is opened. Possible values are =all=,
  =unused= and =nil=:
  - =unused= will lazy install only unused layers
  - =all= will lazy install any layer that support lazy installation even the
    used layers
  - =nil= disable the lazy installation feature
  Default value is =unused=
- New variable =dotspacemacs-frozen-packages=. It is a list of packages, these
  packages cannot be updated or rollbacked.
- New variable =dotspacemacs-install-packages= which replaces the variable
  =dotspacemacs-delete-orphan-packages=. This new variable defines the behavior
  of Spacemacs for installed packages.
  Possible values are =used-only=, =used-but-keep-unused= and =all=.
  - =used-only= installs only explicitly used packages and uninstall any
  unused packages as well as their unused dependencies.
  - =used-but-keep-unused= installs only the used packages but won't uninstall
  them if they become unused.
  - =all= installs *all* packages supported by Spacemacs and never uninstall
  them.
  Default value is =used-only=.
- New variable =dotspacemacs-emacs-command-key= which replaces the variable
  =dotspacemacs-command-key=. This variable represents the key to press after
  the leader key to execute =M-x=. Default value is ~SPC~.
- New variable =dotspacemacs-folding-method= to allow choosing between
  different code folding methods. Currently supported are =evil= and =origami=.
  Default value is =evil=. (thanks to ralesi)
- New variable =dotspacemacs-ex-substitute-global=, if non-nil then
  the behavior of the =g= flag in =:substitute= ex-command is inverted.
  Default value is nil (thanks to fbergroth)
- New variable =dotspacemacs-smart-closing-parenthesis=. If non-nil pressing
  the closing parenthesis ~)~ key in insert mode passes over any automatically
  added closing parenthesis, bracket, quote, etc...
  This can be temporary disabled by pressing ~C-q~ before ~)~. Default is nil.
  (thanks to StreakyCobra)
- New variable =dotspacemacs-retain-visual-mode-on-shift=, If non nil ~>~ is
  remapped to ~>gv~ and ~<~ is remapped to ~<gv~ in visual mode, default
  value is nil (thanks to Stebalien)
- New variable =dotspacemacs-visual-line-move-text=, if non-nil, ~J~ and ~K~
  move lines up and down when in visual mode. Default value is nil.
  (thanks to Stebalien)
- New variable =dotspacemacs-helm-use-fuzzy=. It controls fuzzy matching in
  helm. If set to =always=, force fuzzy matching in all non-asynchronous
  sources. If set to =source=, preserve individual source settings. Else,
  disable fuzzy matching in all sources. Default value is =always=
  (thanks to quicknir)
- New variable =dotspacemacs-elpa-subdirectory=. Can be =nil= or a form that
  evaluates to a package directory. For example, to use different package
  directories for different Emacs versions, set this to =emacs-version=
  (thanks to bmag, TheBB and emacs18)
- New variable =dotspacemacs-startup-buffer-responsive= to enable the
  recenter of the home buffer contents when the window is resized.
  (thanks to TheBB)

  - ~SPC x O~ to  use avy to select multiple links in the frame and open them
  (thanks to StreakyCobra)

  (thanks to StreakyCobra)
- New key binding ~SPC b N~ and evil ex-command =:enew= to open a new empty
  buffer (thanks to balajisivaraman)

  - ~SPC B b~ to list all the buffers in all layouts
  (thanks to CestDiego)
- Refactor ~SPC w~ and ~SPC b~ regarding deletion to clean redundant actions
  and bring more consistency between the two prefixes:
  - ~SPC b k~ has been removed
  - ~SPC b m~ (buffer move) has been removed because the functionality
    is available via ~SPC w~ with ~SPC w h/j/k/l~, ~SPC w H/J/K/L~ and
    ~SPC w M~.
  - ~SPC b K~ (kill other buffers) is now ~SPC b m~ to map with ~SPC w m~
    (kill other window or maximize). Using the universal prefix argument
    ~SPC u SPC b m~ will also kill the windows.
  - ~SPC b C-k~ (kill buffer matching regexp) is now on ~SPC b C-d~
  - ~SPC b D~ now kills a buffer using =ace-window=.
  - ~SPC b d~ and ~SPC b D~ now accept an universal prefix argument to
    also delete the window. So ~SPC u SPC b d~ and ~SPC u SPC b D~ delete
    the buffer and the window.
- Command prefix ~SPC j~ is now also for =jumping=, introduced key bindings are:
  - ~SPC j 0~ to go to the beginning of line (and set a mark at the previous
    location in the line)
  - ~SPC j $~ to go to the end of line (and set a mark at the previous location
    in the line)
  - ~SPC j b~ to undo a jump (go back to previous location)
  - ~SPC j d~ to jump to a listing of the current directory
  - ~SPC j D~ to jump to a listing of the current directory (other window)

  - ~SPC j j~ to jump to a character in the buffer (works as an evil motion)
  - ~SPC j J~ to jump to a suite of two characters in the buffer
    (works as an evil motion)
  - ~SPC j I~ to jump to a definition in any buffer (imenu)
  - ~SPC j k~ to jump to next line and indent it using auto-indent rules
  - ~SPC j l~ to jump to a line with avy (works as an evil motion)
  - ~SPC j n~ to split the current line at point, insert a new line and
     auto-indent
  - ~SPC j s~ to split a quoted string or s-expression in place
  - ~SPC j S~ to split a quoted string or s-expression, insert a new line and
    auto-indent
  - ~SPC j u~ to jump to a URL in the current buffer
  - ~SPC j v~ to jump to the definition/declaration of the variable around point

*** IMPORTANT - Breaking changes
- =org-plus-contrib= is now installed from org ELPA repository, you may
  encounter strange behaviours from Org. In this case delete the =org= directory
  in the =elpa= directory and restart Emacs.
- =Helm= key bindings have been slightly adjusted:
  - in =helm-find-files= (~SPC f f~): now ~C-h~ move up a directory and ~C-l~
    enter the selected directory. =describe-key= command is available on ~C-S-h~
  - in other =helm= buffers ~C-h~ is used to go to the next source and ~C-l~
     is the same as ~RET~. =describe-key= command is also available on ~C-S-h~.
- ~Y~ has been remapped to ~y$~
- The =bookmark= saved file has been moved to the =.cache= directory, if
  you have a bookmark file =~/.emacs.d/bookmarks= then you'll have to move it
  to =~/.emacs.d/.cache/bookmarks=
- =Ruby on Rails= framework has now its own layer called =ruby-on-rails=,
  be sure to add this layer to your dotfile if you use RoR.
- =Django= framework has now its own layer called =django=,
  be sure to add this layer to your dotfile if you use it.
- =guide-key= has been replaced by =which-key=, you may encounter issues
  if you have some =guide-key= custom configuration, remove any =guide-key=
  configuration and check the options offered by =which-key=.
*** Other important notes
- All layers have been moved to =layers= directory
- Category folder prefix has been changed to =+= (was =!=)
- =spacemacs= layer has been moved to the =layers= directory in the
  category =+distribution=
- All =extensions= directories have been renamed to =local=. =extensions=
  directories will be deprecated in 0.105.0.
- =tromey= ELPA repository has been removed (thanks to robbyoconnor)
*** Hot new features
- Enhanced layer package lists which merge old extension lists and package
  lists. Keywords can be associated with packages. The supported keywords
  are =:location=, =:step= and =:excluded=.
  =extensions.el= files and =<layer>-excluded-packages= variables are now
  optional and will be deprecated in the next version 0.105.0.
- New =distribution= concept: you can now choose between two distributions:
  =spacemacs= or =spacemacs-base=. =spacemacs-base= contains only
  a minimal set of packages whereas =spacemacs= is the full Spacemacs
  experience. Set the distribution with =dotspacemacs-distribution= variable.
- Add support for =Quelpa= which allows to use =Melpa= recipes to install
  packages directly from source (i.e. one can now install a package directly
  from a Github repository).
- New editing style: =hybrid=. This style is similar to Vim style except that

- Fix evilification of =evil-escape= starter key
** 0.103.0 (2015/07/01)
*** IMPORTANT: Breaking changes
- Spacemacs is now compatible only with =Magit 2.1= and later, be
  sure to update your packages.
- =auctex= layer has been renamed =latex=, be sure to update your
  dotfile if you use this layer.
- =erlang/elixir= layer has been split into two layers =erlang= and
  =elixir=, be sure to update your dotfile if you use these layers.
- =git= layer has been split into two layers: =git= and =github= so
  the layer variable =git-enabled-github-support= is deprecated, you
  have to add the layer =github= in your dotfile.
- =git-gutter= has been replaced by =diff-hl=. This package is in
  the new layer =version-control=, be sure to add this new layer to
  your dotfile.
- Projectile key bindings changes:
  ~SPC p e~ is now ~SPC p r~ (recent files)
  ~SPC p R~ is now ~SPC p G~ (regenerate tags)
  ~SPC p r~ is now ~SPC p R~ (replace)
*** Hot new features

* Release 0.101.x
** Hot new features
*** Choose your own editing style
Thanks to the new =holy-mode= Spacemacs can now  be used by Vim users
or Emacs users by setting the =dotspacemacs-editing-style= variable to
='vim= or ='emacs= in the dotfile. In =Emacs= style the leader is
available on =M-m=. It is possible to dynamically switch between the
two style with ~SPC P tab~.
*** Mandatory init function and new Pre and Post init functions
A package is now considered to be used only if there is a corresponding
=<layer>/init-<package>= function explicitly defined.
There is now two new functions to initialize a given package:
- =<layer>/pre-init-<package>= which is called before the init function
- =<layer>/post-init-<package>= which is called after the init function
Even if  a =pre= or =post= function exist for a given package, an =init=
function is still required to consider the package to be used.
*** Auto-completion
Spacemacs now officially support auto-completion. The old layer
=company-mode= has been removed and =auto-complete= has been removed
from the spacemacs layer.
They are now part of a new layer called =auto-completion=.
You'll have to this add layer to your dotfile to enable auto-completion.
*** Syntax checking
Flycheck has been removed from the Spacemacs layer and moved to a new
layer called =syntax-checking=.
You'll have to add this layer to your dotfile to enable the fly syntax
checking.
*** Org
Org packages have been removed from Spacemacs layer and moved to a new
=org= layer.
You'll have to add this layer to your dotfile to enable the Org
configuration of Spacemacs.
*** New shortcuts in startup buffer
Recent files, project and bookmarks can be displayed on the startup
buffer. Check for the new dotfile variable =dotspacemacs-startup-lists=.
(thanks to CarlQLange)
*** New lighter in the mode line
Lighter letters have been updated, now the letter corresponds to the
key binding to toggle the associated mode. For instance auto-completion
is on ⓐ and thus can be toggled with ~SPC t a~.
*** Better package update
The package update should now prevent even more errors when upgrading
a batch of packages.
** Initial Release (2015/04/13)
