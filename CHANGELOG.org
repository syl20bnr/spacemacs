*** IMPORTANT: Breaking changes
- =org-plus-contrib= is now installed from org ELPA repository, you may
  encounter strange behaviours from Org. In this case delete the =org= directory
  in the =elpa= directory and restart Emacs.
- =Helm= key bindings have been slightly adjusted:
  - in =helm-find-files= (~SPC f f~): now ~C-h~ move up a directory and ~C-l~
    enter the selected directory. =describe-key= command is available on ~C-S-h~
  - in other =helm= buffers ~C-h~ is used to go to the next source and ~C-l~
     is the same as ~RET~. =describe-key= command is also available on ~C-S-h~.
- ~Y~ has been remapped to ~y$~
- The =bookmark= saved file has been moved to the =.cache= directory, if
  you have a bookmark file =~/.emacs.d/bookmarks= then you'll have to move it
  to =~/.emacs.d/.cache/bookmarks=
- =Ruby on Rails= framework has now its own layer called =ruby-on-rails=,
  be sure to add this layer to your dotfile if you use RoR.
- =Django= framework has now its own layer called =django=,
  be sure to add this layer to your dotfile if you use it.
- =guide-key= has been replaced by =which-key=, you may encounter issues
  if you have some =guide-key= custom configuration, remove any =guide-key=
  configuration and check the options offered by =which-key=.
*** Other important notes:
- All layers have been moved to =layers= directory
- Category folder prefix has been changed to =+= (was =!=)
- =spacemacs= layer has been moved to the =layers= directory in the
  category =+distribution=
- All =extensions= directories have been renamed to =local=. =extensions=
  directories will be deprecated in 0.105.0.
- =tromey= ELPA repository has been removed (thanks to robbyoconnor)
*** Hot new features:
- Enhanced layer package lists which merge old extension lists and package
  lists. Keywords can be associated with packages. The supported keywords
  are =:location=, =:step= and =:excluded=.
  =extensions.el= files and =<layer>-excluded-packages= variables are now
  optional and will be deprecated in the next version 0.105.0.
- New =distribution= concept: you can now choose between two distributions:
  =spacemacs= or =spacemacs-base=. =spacemacs-base= contains only
  a minimal set of packages whereas =spacemacs= is the full Spacemacs
  experience. Set the distribution with =dotspacemacs-distribution= variable.
- Add support for =Quelpa= which allows to use =Melpa= recipes to install
  packages directly from source (i.e. one can now install a package directly
  from a Github repository).
- New editing style: =hybrid=. This style is similar to Vim style except that
  all Emacs key bindings are available in hybrid (insert) state instead of Vim
  key bindings. Also in this state, the buffers are evilified like in Vim style.
- The default theme of Spacemacs is now =spacemacs-dark=. The Spacemacs themes
  (=spacemacs-dark= and =spacemacs-light=) become the official themes of
  Spacemacs (thanks to nashamri)
- Recovery mode when there is an error in the user dotfile. Now even when your
  dotfile cannot be loaded, Spacemacs will be operational with a minimal set
  of packages available (thanks to cmccloud)
- Add support for dotdirectory =~/.spacemacs.d= which behaves like the Emacs
  dotdirectory (i.e. =~/.spacemacs.d/init.el= is evaluated instead of
  =~/.spacemacs= if the former exists and the latter does not) (thanks to
  justbur)
- Guide-key is replaced by =which-key= which provides an enhanced and better
  live key bindings browsing experience. (thanks to justbur)
- New API to manage the =powerline= mode-line. It is now possible to easily
  define segments and arrange them (thanks to TheBB)
- New web gallery to browse themes in =themes-megapack=, URL: [[http://themegallery.robdor.com][theme gallery
 ]] (thanks to robmerrell)
- New test framework supporting layer specific tests (thanks to TheBB)
- New interactive function =dotspacemacs/test-dotfile= testing the integrity
  of the =.spacemacs= file. This function will detect any unknown layers and
  bad dotspacemacs variable values (thanks to justbur)

  is hidden when there is only one source in the helm buffer (thanks to ralesi)
- New variable =dotspacemacs-helm-position= which can be =bottom=, =top=,
  =left= or =right= (thanks to ralesi)

  allow to deactivate a layer for a set of layers. For instance
  =(auto-completion :disabled-for org git)= will disable auto completion for
  both org and git layers.

  old function =dotspacemacs/config= will be deprecated in 0.105.0.

* Release 0.101.x
** Hot new features
*** Choose your own editing style
Thanks to the new =holy-mode= Spacemacs can now  be used by Vim users
or Emacs users by setting the =dotspacemacs-editing-style= variable to
='vim= or ='emacs= in the dotfile. In =Emacs= style the leader is
available on =M-m=. It is possible to dynamically switch between the
two style with ~SPC P tab~.
*** Mandatory init function and new Pre and Post init functions
A package is now considered to be used only if there is a corresponding
=<layer>/init-<package>= function explicitly defined.
There is now two new functions to initialize a given package:
- =<layer>/pre-init-<package>= which is called before the init function
- =<layer>/post-init-<package>= which is called after the init function
Even if  a =pre= or =post= function exist for a given package, an =init=
function is still required to consider the package to be used.
*** Auto-completion
Spacemacs now officially support auto-completion. The old layer
=company-mode= has been removed and =auto-complete= has been removed
from the spacemacs layer.
They are now part of a new layer called =auto-completion=.
You'll have to this add layer to your dotfile to enable auto-completion.
*** Syntax checking
Flycheck has been removed from the Spacemacs layer and moved to a new
layer called =syntax-checking=.
You'll have to add this layer to your dotfile to enable the fly syntax
checking.
*** Org
Org packages have been removed from Spacemacs layer and moved to a new
=org= layer.
You'll have to add this layer to your dotfile to enable the Org
configuration of Spacemacs.
*** New shortcuts in startup buffer
Recent files, project and bookmarks can be displayed on the startup
buffer. Check for the new dotfile variable =dotspacemacs-startup-lists=.
(thanks to CarlQLange)
*** New lighter in the mode line
Lighter letters have been updated, now the letter corresponds to the
key binding to toggle the associated mode. For instance auto-completion
is on ⓐ and thus can be toggled with ~SPC t a~.
*** Better package update
The package update should now prevent even more errors when upgrading
a batch of packages.
