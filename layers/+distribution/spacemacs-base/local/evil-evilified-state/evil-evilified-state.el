;;; Commentary:

;; Define a `evilified' evil state inheriting from `emacs' state and
;; setting a minimalist list of Vim key bindings (like navigation, search, ...)

;; The shadowed original mode key bindings are automatically reassigned

A map SYMBOL of an alternate evilified map, if nil then

If specified the evilification of MAP is deferred to the loading of the feature
bound to SYMBOL. May be required for some lazy-loaded maps.

One or several EXPRESSIONS with the form `KEY FUNCTION':
