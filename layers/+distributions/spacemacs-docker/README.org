* Description
Cross-platform, cross-device persistent emacs distribution with
automatic dependency management and free cloud builds/backups.

* Features:
1) automatic dependency(SDK, tools) installation for Spacemacs layers. Instead
   of everyone figuring out how to install/build a layer dependencies, we can
   write an installation script once and everyone will automatically get them.
2) Run the same Spacemacs installation across all platforms and devices
   separately or shared (useful for mentoring, collaborative editing etc.)
   [[https://i.imgur.com/ijdSuX6.gifv][DEMO]] - same Spacemacs instance shared between Win 10 Notebook and Ubuntu PC.
   On the both systems Spacemacs window(frame) behaves like if it was a native
   app it even has proper taskbar icon :) Copy-pasta and full-screen also work.
   You can even use Spacemacs in a web-browser! ([[https://i.imgur.com/wDLDMZN.gifv][DEMO]])
   It us useful, for example, if you want to showcase Spacemacs or your personal
   setup with the zero install requirements.
3) Client can disconnect and reconnect(from the same or another machine) to
   a Spacemacs instance without disturbing its execution. [[https://i.imgur.com/3FLISud.gifv][DEMO]].
   It means that you can start Spacemacs at work and simply connect to it from
   a handheld devices on the way back home to check rss feed/email and then
   from a home machine and Spacemacs will be in the exact same state as you
   left it.
4) You can run multiply Spacemacs instances on the same host. [[https://i.imgur.com/v6xeBtW.gifv][DEMO]].
   They can be fully isolated or share only what you want them to share.
   Bandwidth, CPU, disk space quota also supported. It may be really useful
   for education. Imagine a classroom with a bunch of cheap Raspberry PI
   clients and one Spacemacs host(local or cloud based).
5) Pausing(freezing).
6) Snapshots for host migration and potentially the fastest way to start
   Spacemacs based development environment, especially if you use stuff like
   JVM that needs time to "heat up" [[https://i.imgur.com/plTjTXL.gifv][DEMO]]. For GNU/Linux it uses native
   "snapshoter" [[https://criu.org/Main_Page][CRIU]]
7) Disposable sandboxed development environment. Its much harder to damager
   your actual OS and if your experiment gone wrong you can drop all changes.
8) Free cloud builds and storage - especially handy if your internet upload is
   much slower or expensive than download. 
9) Since spacemacs-docker distribution uses common base (Emacs version, OS, 
   packages) it is much easer to reproduce and fix bugs.
10) Docker uses [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/imagesandcontainers/][layered filesystem]] so for updates you'll need to download only
    the changed layer. Also you can make multiply images that share the most of
    data so they require less disk space.
 
* Drawbacks: 
1) While performance with the GNU/Linux host seems to be equal(perceptually)
   to a locally installed Spacemacs, even with a Windows 10 client on a fairly
   ancient laptop(first gen. mobile i3). It's actual better, if you take into
   account code linter, compiler etc.). But if you host both client and server
   on such laptop you'll experience noticeable keyboard lag (probably due to
   low specs and a poor Hyper-V support).
2) You will need Docker on the server machine and(for the most cases) Xpra
   at the client + ssh. But if you don't mind some hacks and want to use Linux
   and run spacemacs-docker locally, then you only need Docker. As a bonus
   you'll get max speed.

* Getting started(AFTER THIS PR IS MERGED)
** For all platform
*** How to build:
- Install docker like [[https://docker.github.io/engine/installation/][normal ppl do]] or
  [[https://get.docker.com/][like if there is no tomorrow(don't forget sudo)]]. 
  Also you'll need [[https://xpra.org][Xpra]] (optionally).
- Fork [[https://github.com/JAremko/spacemacs-docker-seed][the seed repo]], read its [[https://github.com/JAremko/spacemacs-docker-seed/blob/master/README.md][README.org]]
- Register at [[https://hub.docker.com/][DockeHub]] and create an [[https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/][automated builds]] from the fork.
  Also you may want to link it to =spacemacs/onbuild= repository - this way
  your Spacemacs will automatically rebuild each time =spacemacs/onbuild= is
  updated.
*** How to use(with the default settings)
**** Xpra over SSH(GUI):
- =docker run -ti --rm -p 22:22 <YOU_NAME>/spacemacs= it will attach Xpra
  output to the console, it you detach it Docker will kill and delete the
  container (and all changes). So to make it useful you need to mount your
  workspace. To do so add =-v <...>/workspace:/mnt/workspace= where =<...>=
  is the absolute path to your local workspace. Also you probably would like
  to make your layouts and recent files persistent: 
  First create a folder on the host's file system where you want to store
  those files. For example =/tmp/spacemacs-cache= then =docker run= with 
  =-v /tmp/spacemacs-cache:/home/spacemacs/.emacs.d/.cache= (Linux example)
- Then you can attach to it via Xpra:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    xpra attach --encoding=rgb --pulseaudio=no --compress=0\
    ssh:<NAME_FROM_/hooks/build>@localhost:14 
  #+END_SRC
  on Windows executable is called =Xpra_cmd= also you can use Xpra's GUI app
  but it's a good idea to fist run it with log/console output, it will tell
  you if your client misses python libraries.
- You can share your Spacemacs by adding =--sharing=yes= for each Xpra
  client =xpra attach ... --sharing=yes ...=
- Read [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/][Docker run reference]] and [[https://www.xpra.org/trac/wiki/FAQ][Xpra FAQ]].
**** In webbrowser:
- Same as with Xpra over SSH =docker run -ti --rm <YOU_NAME>/spacemacs= but
  instead of =-p 22:22= bind =-p 10000:10000= and add set container's
  environment variable =SDMODE= to =webbrowser_insecure= i.e:
  =docker run ... -e SDMODE=webbrowser_insecure ...= Also you'll need to
  set a password =... -e XPRA_PASSWORD=<YOUR_PASSWORD> ...= 
  Now you can use Spacemacs via webbrowser. URL:
  http://localhost:10000/index.html?encoding=png&password=<YOUR_PASSWORD>
  or use http://localhost:10000/connect.html if you want to configure
  keyboard layout, encoding, full-screen mode etc. To get proper full-screen
  you need to fist enter browser full-screen at this page and then connect
  to the Spacemacs.
  The mode is called *"webbrowser_insecure"* because it uses http protocol.
  So you should use it *only for local network*  behind system firewall or
  Docker's one i.e don't bind container's port =10000= to the host's port.
  Find out local IP of the container and use it instead of =localhost=.
  For the remote use you can add [[https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion][TLS proxy]] and may be wrap
  your setup into [[https://docs.docker.com/compose][Docker compose]] for the convenience.
**** Mosh/SSH(terminal):
- Use [[#xpra-over-sshgui][Xpra over SSH(GUI)]] method to launch a new Spacemacs instance
  (or use existing one). Set container's environment variable =SDMODE= to
  =ssh= i.e: =docker run ... -e SDMODE=ssh ...= if you don't need Xpra.
- Then use ssh to connect =ssh <NAME_FROM_/hooks/build>@localhost=
- To use Mosh (which is much better way than ssh) you'll also need to bind
  an UDP port =docker run ... -p 60001:60001/udp ...= then to connect:
  =mosh -p 60001 <NAME_FROM_/hooks/build>@localhost emacs=
** Optimizations
*** Data transfer via mmap(GNU/Linux)
You can use Xpra mmap protocol to greatly reduce CPU usage, but only
if the host and the client are on the same machine(file system).
For this first create a folder on the host's file system where the
mmap will be created. For example =spacemacs-mmap= (it should
be owned by user) then same as with [[#xpra-over-sshgui][Xpra over SSH(GUI)]] but also mount
the folder =-v /tmp/spacemacs-mmap/:/tmp/spacemacs-mmap/= to attach run:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  TMPDIR=/tmp/spacemacs-mmap/ xpra attach --mmap=yes ...
#+END_SRC
the mmap option only works for GNU/Linux See [[https://www.xpra.org/trac/changeset/10846/xpra][change-log]].
*** Use host's network
Instead of using =-p= to map individual ports, you can add
=--network=host= to the =docker run...= it's not only more convenient
way to run stuff, but also more efficient (and less secure). If you use
docker for Mac/Windows you'll may need to figure out your docker machine
IP and use it instead of localhost.
*** Use host's file system
Docker's file system is somewhat slower. If you have "hot" folders you
can mount them to the host's filesystem. See [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/][Docker volumes]].
*** Use host's X11 session instead of SSH/Xpra(GNU/Linux)
This is a hacky way to get absolute best performance. For it to work
host's X11 session owner should have same UID as the spacemacs-docker
user (both are 1000 be the default). Simply mount
=/tmp/.X11-unix= and run Emacs directly without ssh and Xpra: 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  docker run -ti --rm -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix\
   -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY\
   --entrypoint=/usr/bin/emacs\
   -e NO_AT_BRIDGE=1\
   -e SHELL=/bin/bash\
   <YOUR_NAME>/spacemacs
#+END_SRC

* FAQ
** How to set localtime/zone?
Try =docker run ... -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro ...=
or =docker run ... -e TZ=UTC  ...= - Replace =UTC= with your time zone.
** What layers support(currently) automatic dependency installation? 
See [[./dockerfiles/spacemacs-docker/usr/local/spacemacs/deps-installers/README.org][deps-installers/README.org]]
** How to contribute?
You can contribute a dependency installation script for a
currently unsupported layer or  fix/extend existing one.
See [[./dockerfiles/spacemacs-docker/usr/local/spacemacs/lib/README.org][lib/README.org]]. Also you can improve libraries, docs.
** What's up with the Dockerfile formatting?
Docker build logs are ugly anyway. At least we can keep Dockerfiles
as readable as possible. Also Emacs-Lisp DSL prints out executed
command and its output (if any) so we don't need to dig into usual
 docker builder's wall of text.
** How to update?
- First get a new version =docker pull <YOUR_NAME>/spacemacs=
- Then run it. And if it is fine, remove the old one:
  1) Get image list =docker images=.
  2) Remove an image =docker rmi <IMAGE>=.
** How to get an older build(backup) of my Spacemacs?
You can [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/#/pull-an-image-by-digest-immutable-identifier][pull by the digest]]. Also you can use digest in the =FROM=
Dockerfile instruction.
** TODO Add answers to the questions from the PR

* Troubleshooting
** Font size/screen is messed-up. Help!
If you have more than one display/projector or other displaying
device connected, Xpra may use DPI from the wrong device. You can
specify DPI at the client with =xpra attach --dpi=<DPI> ...= and/or
at the server side. [[https://github.com/JAremko/spacemacs-docker-seed/blob/master/Dockerfile#L33][See Seed project's Dockerfile]].
** Mosh fonts/space-line doesn't look right
You probably need to install =NanumGothic= and =source-code-pro= fonts
** I have a lag/picture is blurry/clipboard sharing doesn't work...
Xpra has many setting that can be changed on the fly(some of them have
hot-keys). While attached, click Xpra logo near the system clock on the
taskbar(Windows) and make sure that the configs are right.
** Ranger sometimes lags with the message "... process ... something ..."
*** TODO localize the bug. Current status: heisenbug :(
** Sometimes(rarely) I have strange Emacs slowdowns
*** TODO Find out what's going one.
