;;; Commentary:

;; Define a `evilified' evil state inheriting from `emacs' state and
;; setting a minimalist list of Vim key bindings (like navigation, search, ...)

;; The shadowed original mode key bindings are automatically reassigned
;; following a set of rules:
;; Keys such as 
;; /,:,h,j,k,l,n,N,v,V,gg,G,C-f,C-b,C-d,C-e,C-u,C-y and C-z 
;; are working as in Evil.
;; Other keys will be moved according to this pattern:
;; a -> A -> C-a -> C-A
;; The first unreserved key will be used. 
;; There is an exception for g, which will be directly
;; bound to C-G, since G and C-g (latest being an important escape key in Emacs) 
;; are already being used.

`:evilified-map SYMBOL'
A map SYMBOL of an alternate evilified map, if nil then
`evil-evilified-state-map' is used.

`:eval-after-load SYMBOL'
If specified the evilification of MAP is deferred to the loading of the feature
bound to SYMBOL. May be required for some lazy-loaded maps.

`:pre-bindings EXPRESSIONS'
One or several EXPRESSIONS with the form `KEY FUNCTION':
   KEY1 FUNCTION1
   KEY2 FUNCTION2
These bindings are set in MAP before the evilification happens.

`:bindings EXPRESSIONS'
One or several EXPRESSIONS with the form `KEY FUNCTION':
   KEY1 FUNCTION1
   KEY2 FUNCTION2
These bindings are set directly in evil-evilified-state-map submap.
