* Description
This layer adds various adjustments to packages to create an evilified experience
throughout the entirety of Spacemacs.

** Features:
- Add evil tutorial with =evil-tutor=
- Add relative line number with =linum-relative= (only in Emacs 25.x and older)
- Add escaping under ~fd~ by default with =evil-escape=
- Add occurrences count in mode-line when searching a buffer
- Add support for lisp structure manipulation with =evil-lisp-state=
- Add safe structural editing of lisp dialects with =evil-cleverparens=
- Add =evil-exchange= to swap text
- Add easy live editing of multiple occurrences with =evil-iedit-state=
- Add new vim text objects for indentation with =evil-indent-plus=
- Add operations to align text with =evil-lion=
- Easy management of comments with =evil-nerd-commenter=
- Navigation between pairs with =evil-matchit=
- Advanced navigation on brackets with =evil-unimpaired=
- Easy increment and decrement of numbers with =evil-number=
- Support for additional vim movements via =evil-args=
- Support for surrounding the marked area with a given character via =evil-surround=
- Evilification of various modes if the editing style is =vim= or =hybrid=
- Improves the comment function to be able to also do the inverse operation
- Persistent highlight of searched text with =evil-search-highlight-persist=
- Display tildes in non-buffer area with =vim-empty-lines-mode=
- Add =evil-collection=

* Install
The =spacemacs-evil= layer is included by default in the Spacemacs distribution.

* Note about evil-collection
[[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection][evil-collection]] is a collection of Evil bindings for the parts of Emacs that
Evil does not cover properly by default, such as help-mode, M-x calendar, Eshell
and more.

However, there is a large overlap of features provided by both =Spacemacs= and
=evil-collection=. For the same feature, =Spacemacs= implementation is often better
than =evil-collection=.

That's said, when =evil-collection= is used carefully we can reduce the amount of
effort wasted on ~reinventing the wheel~ on =Spacemacs= side.

Spacemacs provides a layer variable =spacemacs-evil-collection-allowed-list= for
users and layer hackers to enable evil-collection on their desired modes.

For users, if you want to enable evil-collection on =eglot=, then you will need
to declare this layer with it variable explicitly:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (spacemacs-evil :variables
                      spacemacs-evil-collection-allowed-list
                     '(eglot))
#+END_EXAMPLE

For Spacemacs hackers check out git layer to see how we apply =evil-collection= to
=magit.=
