* Description
This layer does basic setup for completion frameworks like =helm=, =ivy= and
=ido=.

Its main role is to ensure sane defaults and consistent UI between =helm=
and =ivy= because even when you are using only one of them you could still
need to use the other (for instance a package that supports only =helm=).

Advanced configuration of these packages can be found in their respective
layers in =+completion= layer directory.

** Features:
- Base preconfiguration of =helm= and =ivy= for other layers to use.
- Basic support for =ido-navigation= configuration and transient state.
