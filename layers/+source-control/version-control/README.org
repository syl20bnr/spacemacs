* Description
This layers adds general configuration for [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Version-Control.html][Emacs VC]].
It should work with all VC backends such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, SVN, etc...

** Features:
- highlights uncommitted changes in the fringe or margin with [[https://github.com/dgutov/diff-hl][diff-hl]], [[https://github.com/syohex/emacs-git-gutter][git-gutter]], or [[https://github.com/nonsequitur/git-gutter-plus][git-gutter+]]
- adds vcs transient-state ~SPC g.~ to allow quick navigation and modification of buffer hunks.

* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =version-control= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

* Configuration
You can choose the package to facilitate the diff transient-state and show
margins by setting the =version-control-diff-tool= variable to one of the
supported packages:
- [[https://github.com/dgutov/diff-hl][diff-hl]]
- [[https://github.com/syohex/emacs-git-gutter][git-gutter]] (default)
- [[https://github.com/nonsequitur/git-gutter-plus][git-gutter+]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  '(version-control :variables
                    version-control-diff-tool 'diff-hl)
#+END_SRC

You can choose the side on which the diff appears (by default it's the right side)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  '(version-control :variables
                    version-control-diff-side 'left)
#+END_SRC

To automatically enable diff margins in all buffers, set
=version-control-global-margin=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  '(version-control :variables
                    version-control-global-margin t)
#+END_SRC

** Differences between margin packages
This layer contains generalized mappings for three diff margin packages:
=diff-hl=, =git-gutter=, and =git-gutter+=.

There are some differences between packages that might have some people prefer
one over the other:

| Feature                             | diff-hl | git-gutter | git-gutter+ |
|-------------------------------------+---------+------------+-------------|
| Show in fringe                      | X       | X          | X           |
| Extended VCS support (e.g. hg, svn) | X       | X          |             |
| Stage hunks from buffer             |         | X          | X           |
| Dired support                       | X       |            |             |

** VC Directory buffer commands
You can hit ~SPC pv~ from the current project to open the VC Directory buffer,
or use ~SPC g v d~ for specifying a root directory.
Then you may mark (=m= key) files you are interested in, to form a fileset.
Most commands described above are applicable to filesets too.
To some of them are given shortcuts:

| Key binding | Description                       |
|-------------+-----------------------------------|
| ~=~         | Compare selected files with head  |
| ~c~         | Open a =commit message buffer=    |

| ~a~         | Annotate selected files           |
| ~i~         | Add into a version control system |
| ~r~         | Refresh directory view            |
| ~E~         | Ignore file under cursor          |

Navigation and interaction commands in the VC Directory buffer:
