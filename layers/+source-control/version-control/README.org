* Description
This layers adds general configuration for [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Version-Control.html][Emacs VC]].
It should work with all VC backends such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, SVN, etc...

** Features
- highlights uncommitted changes in the fringe or margin with [[https://github.com/dgutov/diff-hl][diff-hl]],
git-gutter, or git-gutter+
- adds vcs transient-state ~SPC g.~ to allow quick navigation and modification of
buffer hunks.

* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =version-control= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

* Configuration
You can choose the package to facilitate the diff transient-state and show margins
by setting =version-control-diff-tool=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
'(version-control :variables
                  version-control-diff-tool 'diff-hl)
#+END_SRC

You can choose the side on which the diff appears (by default it's the right side)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
'(version-control :variables
                  version-control-diff-side 'left)
#+END_SRC

To automatically enable diff margins in all buffers, set
=version-control-global-margin=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
'(version-control :variables
                  version-control-global-margin t)
#+END_SRC

** Differences between margin programs
This layer contains generalized mappings for three diff margin packages:
diff-hl, git-gutter, and git-gutter+.

There are some differences between packages that might have some people prefer
one over the other:

| Feature                             | diff-hl | git-gutter | git-gutter+ |
|-------------------------------------+---------+------------+-------------|
| Show in fringe                      | X       | X          | X           |
| Extended VCS support (e.g. hg, svn) | X       | X          |             |
| Stage hunks from buffer             |         | X          | X           |
| Dired support                       | X       |            |             |
