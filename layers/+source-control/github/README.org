* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =github= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

** Git configuration
You will need to generate a [[https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line][personal access token]] on GitHub. This token should
have the =gist= and =repo= permissions. Once this token is created, it needs to
be added to your =~/.gitconfig=

You will also need to [[https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/][generate an SSH key]] and [[https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/][add it to your GitHub account]].

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git config --global github.oauth-token <token>
#+END_SRC

** Forge
The =forge= package uses =emacsql= which requires a C compiler to be available
on MS Windows, see issue [[https://github.com/skeeto/emacsql/issues/46]].

For this reason the =forge= package is not installed on MS Windows by default.
If you still want to install it (which means you do have a C compiler available
in your PATH) then use the =dotspacemacs-additional-packages= variable in your
dotfile:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (dotspacemacs-additional-packages '((forge :toggle t)))
#+END_SRC

** grip-mode
Grip-mode [[https://github.com/seagle0128/grip-mode#prerequisite][requires python and the python package grip]] to be installed on the
system. Grip can usually be installed with the command =pip install grip=,
on debian based systems make sure you use the python 3 version
of pip, it is normally called =pip3=.
