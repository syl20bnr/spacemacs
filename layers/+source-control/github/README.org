* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =github= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

** Git configuration
You will need to generate a [[https://github.com/settings/tokens][personal access token]] on GitHub. This token should
have the =gist= and =repo= permissions. Once this token is created, it needs to
be added to your =~/.gitconfig=

You will also need to [[https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/][generate an SSH key]] and [[https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/][add it to your GitHub account]].

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git config --global github.oauth-token <token>
#+END_SRC

** Hub configuration
For now, =Magithub= requires the =hub= utility to work -- before trying to use
Magithub, follow the installation instructions at hub.github.com. To force hub
to authenticate, you can use hub browse in a terminal (inside a GitHub repo).

** Magithub configuration
Spacemacs configures =Magithub= to be in offline mode by default and disables
displaying the GitHub project status, issues, and pull requests because loading
project data for repositories with many pull requests or issues can be
exorbitantly slow (see [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/11176][issue #11176]]). To toggle online mode and the project
status, issues, and pull requests sections for the current repository, open in
the =magit status= buffer (~SPC g s~) and then open the Magithub settings popup
(~@ C~). To enable online mode and the project status, pull requests, and
issues sections by default, use the following shell commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git config --global --bool magithub.online true
  git config --global --bool magithub.status.includeStatusHeader true
  git config --global --bool magithub.status.includePullRequestsSection true
  git config --global --bool magithub.status.includeIssuesSection true
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, use the following Emacs forms:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (magit-set "true" "--global" "magithub.online")
  (magit-set "true" "--global" "magithub.status.includeStatusHeader")
  (magit-set "true" "--global" "magithub.status.includePullRequestsSection")
  (magit-set "true" "--global" "magithub.status.includeIssuesSection")
#+END_SRC

* Key Bindings
** magit-gh-pulls
In a =magit status= buffer (~SPC g s~):

| Key Binding | Description                                                 |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~# c~       | create a pull request                                       |
| ~# g~       | get a list of (or reload) all PRs in the current repository |
| ~# f~       | fetch the commits associated with the current PR at point   |

| ~# o~       | open PR at point in browser                                 |

Note that =magit-gh-pulls= will try to fast-forward the PRs whenever it is
possible.
