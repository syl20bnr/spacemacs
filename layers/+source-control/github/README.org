* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =github= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

** Git configuration
You will need to generate a [[https://github.com/settings/tokens][personal access token]] on GitHub. This token should
have the =gist= and =repo= permissions. Once this token is created, it needs to
be added to your =~/.gitconfig=

You will also need to [[https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/][generate an SSH key]] and [[https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/][add it to your GitHub account]].

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git config --global github.oauth-token <token>
#+END_SRC

** Hub configuration
For now, =Magithub= requires the =hub= utility to work -- before trying to use
Magithub, follow the installation instructions at hub.github.com. To force hub
to authenticate, you can use hub browse in a terminal (inside a GitHub repo).

* Key Bindings
** magit-gh-pulls
In a =magit status= buffer (~SPC g s~):
