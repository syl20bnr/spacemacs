* Description
This layer provides various styles of line numbering in Spacemacs. It replaces
=linum= and =linum-relative= with the improved =nlinum= and =nlinum-relative=
packages.

Please note that on Emacs 26 and newer, this layer also replaces the new native
line numbers mode (=display-line-numbers-mode=), and because of that it is not
recommended to use =nlinum= layer on Emacs 26 or newer.

** Features:
- Support for classic ascending line numbering.
- Support for line numbering relative to the current cursor position.
