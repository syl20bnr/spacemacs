* Description

This layer adds an alternative "modal editing mode for Emacs, like vi, but
the design of key/command choice is based on command frequency statistics
and ease-of-key score. Most frequently used commands have most easy keys."
[[http://ergoemacs.org/misc/ergoemacs_vi_mode.html][xah-fly-keys]] has been developed over years of experience by Xah Lee, a long
time contributer to the Emacs community.

Gain the modal superpowers of the dark side, without succumbing to evil!

** Features:

- You NEVER need to press 【Ctrl+x】! Use leader key instead!
- There are about 200 commands with leader key sequence.
- Efficient keys for common navigation and editing tasks in command mode.
- Keybindings based on experience and [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/command-frequency.html][observed frequency of use]].
- Never need to press Meta!

* Install

To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =xah-fly-keys= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in 
this file. You should have the =dotspacemacs-editing-style= set to ='emacs=.

It is recommended to change some of the defaults in your =.spacemacs= file, in
order to avoid some unwanted cross-over with some keybindings.

  - set =dotspacemacs-colorize-cursor-according-to-state nil= so that the cursor
    will reflect the =xah-fly-keys= state instead.
  - set the =dotspacemacs-leader-key= to an empty string, as having it set to 
    ="SPC"= interferes with the =which-key= mappings.

** Configuration

This layer assumes a "qwerty" layout and uses that as a default.  You can configure
xah-fly-keys to behave with other keyboard layouts with the =xah-fly-keys-layout=
variable. Possible values are `qwerty', `qwerty-abnt', `qwertz', `dvorak',
`programer-dvorak', `colemak', `colemak-mod-dh', `workman'".

For example, in your layers list:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(xah-fly-keys :variables xah-fly-keys-layout "dvorak")
#+END_SRC

** Swap the leader keys
If you'd like to have the spacemacs leader key on the space bar rather than the xah-fly-keys
menu, it is possible to swap these keys.

I tried implementing this with a config variable, but it doesn't quite work as expected.
Until that is sorted out, add this to your =dotspacemacs/user-config= to swap the leader
keys for Spacemacs and xah-fly-keys.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun xah-fly-keys-swap-spacemacs-leader ()
      (progn
        (define-key xah-fly-key-map (kbd "SPC") 'spacemacs-cmds)
        (define-key xah-fly-key-map (kbd "M-m") 'xah-fly-leader-key-map)))

(add-hook 'xah-fly-command-mode-activate-hook 'xah-fly-keys-swap-spacemacs-leader)
#+END_SRC

You'll also need to set the =dotspacemacs-emacs-leader= key to an empty string.
It appears that sometimes the =which-key= menu will be affected by this change.

* Key bindings

See [[http://ergoemacs.org/misc/ergoemacs_vi_mode.html][xah-fly-keys]] for the modal keymap defined by Xah Lee.

** Sub keymaps

You'll notice there are several sub keymaps after pressing the leader key.
These are organized by ease of use, and should really be categorized by
finger and keyboard row.  I've listed some of the functionality for each of the
keymaps, but use =which-key= and you'll discover more details.

- 【SPC ,】 - Eval, kill emacs
- 【SPC k】 - registers, replace, occur
- 【SPC o】 - rectangles, macros, number registers
- 【SPC l】 - modes, view, windows
- 【SPC j】 - help, apropos, info
- 【SPC d】 - inserting chars, brackets, unicode
- 【SPC i】 - files, bookmarks, external apps
- 【SPC w】 - xref, find identifiers
- 【SPC e】 - search, highlight, fonts
- 【SPC TAB】 - indent, expand, abbrev
