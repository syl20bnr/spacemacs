* Programming languages
** General-purpose
*** Imperative
**** Forth layer
[[file:+lang/forth/README.org][link]]
This layer adds basic support for the Forth family of languages to spacemacs.

Features:
- Syntax highlighting
- Showing meaning of objects in context of the current =Forth= session.
- Eval of entire files or regions in current =Forth= session.
- Passing interactive commands to current =Forth= session.

**** asm layer
[[file:+lang/asm/README.org][link]]
This layer adds support for Assembly code. The built-in major mode for
editing assembly code in Emacs is =asm-mode=.

The layer also adds =nasm-mode= for NASM-specific syntax. Although =nasm-mode=
is intended for NASM, it actually works well with other variants of Assembly
in general, and provides Imenu integration so you can jump around with ~SPC s j~.

Features:
- Improved syntax highlighting.
- Automatic indentation.
- Auto-completion for symbol in opened buffers.
- Look up documentation for current instruction at cursor.
- Imenu integration.
