* Description
This layer adds support for the famous [[https://evernote.com/][Evernote]] note taking service to Spacemacs.
It does so by grouping together various packages to work with [[https://evernote.com/][Evernote]].

** Features:
- Create notes in markdown and sync with [[https://evernote.com/][Evernote]] via [[http://www.geeknote.me][geeknote]].
- Search for notes using keywords
- Move notes between notebooks

* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =evernote= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

** Geeknote
This is the non official =Evernote= command line tool which allows users
to write notes in markdown, and sync them. The command [[http://www.geeknote.me][geeknote]] is expected
to be present in your =$PATH=. To obtain this utility, please refer to the
official =geeknote= [[http://www.geeknote.me/documentation/][documentation]].

** Geeknote.el
[[https://github.com/avendael/emacs-geeknote][geeknote.el]] is a wrapper for some of the most used =geeknote= commands.
By default, =geeknote.el= doesnâ€™t have any key bindings defined.
This layer provides key bindings for all of =geeknote.el's= exposed features.
=geeknote.el= relies on having a correctly setup =geeknote= editor.
To set this up, run the following command in your terminal after successfully
installing =geeknote=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ geeknote settings --editor "emacsclient"
#+END_SRC

If you would prefer to customize the =geeknote= command to be used such as
specifying the path to the =geeknote= python script, please refer to the
=geeknote.el= [[https://github.com/avendael/emacs-geeknote][documentation]]. For more information about setting up =$PATH=,
check out the corresponding section in the FAQ (~SPC h SPC $PATH RET~).
