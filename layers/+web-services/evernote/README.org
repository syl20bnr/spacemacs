* Description
This layer groups together packages to work with [[https://evernote.com/][Evernote]].

It uses the non official Evernote command line tool [[http://www.geeknote.me][geeknote]] which allows users
to write notes in markdown, and sync them.

[[https://github.com/avendael/emacs-geeknote][geeknote.el]] is a wrapper for some of the most used =geeknote= commands. By
default, =geeknote.el= doesn't have key bindings defined. This contribution
layer provides key bindings for all of geeknote.el's exposed features.

* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =evernote= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

** geeknote
The command =geeknote= is expected to be present in your =$PATH=. To
obtain this utility, please refer to the official geeknote
[[http://www.geeknote.me/documentation/][documentation]].

** geeknote.el
=geeknote.el= relies on having a correctly setup geeknote editor. To set
this up, run the following command in your terminal after successfully
installing =geeknote=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ geeknote settings --editor "emacsclient"
#+END_SRC

If you would prefer to customize the geeknote command to be used such as
specifying the path to the geeknote python script, please refer to the
=geeknote.el= [[https://github.com/avendael/emacs-geeknote][documentation]]. For more information about setting up =$PATH=,
check out the corresponding section in the FAQ (~SPC h SPC $PATH RET~).
