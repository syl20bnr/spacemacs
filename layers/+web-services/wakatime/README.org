* Description
This layer adds support for Wakatime.

WakaTime was built to solve time tracking for programmers.
Since we work inside a text editor, why should we have to start and stop a
timer? WakaTime uses open-source text editor plugins to automatically track the
time you spend programming so you never have to manually track it again!

P.S. wakati means time in Swahili

** Features:
- Integration with Wakatime cloud based time tracking service

* Install
** Wakatime Program
You can follow wakatime installation instructions here
[[https://github.com/wakatime/wakatime-mode]].

In short it's just:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pip install wakatime
#+END_SRC

And for some linux users

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo pip install wakatime
#+END_SRC

** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =wakatime= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
                '(
                  ;; ...
                  (wakatime :variables
                  wakatime-api-key  "your-api-key"
                  ;; use the actual wakatime path
                  wakatime-cli-path "/usr/bin/wakatime")
                  ;; ...
                 ))
#+END_SRC

*** Note about api key and bug submission
If you use the built-in Spacemacs bug submission tool it will include
all of your layer configs including your secret api key.
Please remove it before submitting.

Even better don't store your key directly in the layer config.
Instead put the following code in your user-config which is set after your layer config:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq wakatime-api-key "your-api-key")
#+END_SRC

Everything you set there won't appear in the bug submitting tool.

** API Keys
After this go to your wakatime account and have your API key handy
[[https://wakatime.com/settings/account?apikey=true]].

Restart emacs and it will prompt you for the location of the wakatime installer
(just put in whatever =which wakatime= gives you in the terminal e.g.
=/usr/bin/wakatime= for example) and that's it.

*** Note to =venv-workon= users:
Right now wakatime uses =python= as python bin executable, so if you use
=venv-workon= because you have python projects which need to have a virtual
env., then wakatime, which is installed system-wide will have trouble locating
wakatime files, so it's best to define by yourself the python path where
wakatime can always find it's stuff, via this variable:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq wakatime-python-bin "/path/to/python")
#+END_SRC
