* Description
This layer provide support for [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/rcirc.html][rcirc]] with optional support for authinfo
and ZNC.

** Features:
- Store channel logs into =~/.emacs.d/.cache/rcirc-logs/<channel>=
- Support for credentials stored in =~/.authinfo.gpg= (need to have gnutls)
- Support ZNC support (with optional =~/.authinfo.gpg=)
- Colored nicknames
- Real-time change when people use =s/foo/bar/= in chat
- Completion of Emojis using [[https://github.com/dunn/company-emoji][company-emoji]] (still needs a way of showing, either
  using the =emoji= layer or having a proper font) :clap:

* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =rcirc= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

** Configuring authentication
There are several ways to configure rcirc supported by the layer:
- By storing your credentials in =rcirc-server-alist= in your dotfile (not
  secured)
- By storing your credentials in =rcirc-server-alist= in your Dropbox (better
  but still not secured)
- By storing your credentials in authinfo (secured)
- By using a ZNC bouncer _and_ storing your credentials (secured)

*** Storing the credentials in your dotfile
You can store your servers configuration along with your credentials in the
=dotspacemacs/user-config= of your dotfile.

*Important:* This method is the less secured and it is not recommended since
your dotfile is often stored in a public repository and is not crypted. This
is convenient but not recommended.

**** Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq rcirc-server-alist
    '(("irc.freenode.net"
        :user-name "spacemacs_user" :encryption tls
        :port "6697"
        :password "le_passwd"
        :channels ("#emacs"))))
#+END_SRC

*** Storing the credentials in your Dropbox
You can store your servers configuration along with your credentials in
your dropbox in the file =~/Dropbox/emacs/pinit-rcirc.el=.

*Important:* This method is more secured since your file is stored in
a private location but it is still not crypted on your drive. Moreover
since Dropbox automatically sync your files you may have a lot of copies
of the file containing your credentials. This is convenient but not
recommended.

**** Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq rcirc-server-alist
    '(("irc.freenode.net"
        :user-name "spacemacs_user"
        :port "1337"
        :password "le_passwd"
        :channels ("#emacs"))))
#+END_SRC

*** Storing the credentials in authinfo
This method is considered secured and is the recommended way to configure
rcirc.
1) If you want to use =authinfo.gpg= you have to enable the support for it by
   setting =rcirc-enable-authinfo-support= to =t= in your dotfile:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
       (rcirc :variables rcirc-enable-authinfo-support t)))
   #+END_SRC

2) In your =~/.authinfo.gpg= file store your credentials like this:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     machine irc.freenode.net port nickserv user <user> password <passwd>
   #+END_EXAMPLE

3) At last you need to provide your servers configuration in the
   =dotspacemacs/user-config= function of your dotfile:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq rcirc-server-alist
     '(("irc.freenode.net"
         :user-name "spacemacs_user"
         :port "1337"
         :channels ("#emacs"))))
   #+END_SRC

*** Connecting behind a ZNC bouncer and storing the credentials in authinfo
This methods is also secured since it uses authinfo _but_ you must secure your
ZNC server configuration as well!

ZNC is a popular bouncer which is easy to setup. A bouncer is a proxy that
connects to your IRC channels on your behalf, instead of connecting to the IRC
server you connect to your ZNC server. The ZNC server can store the discussions
in a buffer while you are not connected.

**** Disclaimer
This assumes that you are familiar with ZNC and you have a ZNC server properly
setup. If it is not the case then it is recommended to read about ZNC
[[http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC][here]]. There is also an installation guide for Ubuntu [[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-znc-an-irc-bouncer-on-an-ubuntu-vps][here]].

**** Note
For now authinfo is mandatory to use the ZNC configuration.
1) To enable ZNC support set the variable =rcirc-enable-znc-support= to =t= in
   your dotfile:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
       (rcirc :variables rcirc-enable-znc-support t)))
   #+END_SRC

2) In your =~/.authinfo.gpg= file store your credentials like this:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     machine freenode.spacemacsserver.me port irc user spacemacs_user/freenode password ZNC_PASSWORD
     machine geekshed.spacemacsserver.me port irc user spacemacs_user/geekshed password ZNC_PASSWORD
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   *Important* =port= must be set to =irc=. This is a convention of the layer to
   retrieve the credentials for the ZNC configuration.
3) Then setup your servers configuration using subdomains in the
   =dotspacemacs/user-config= function of your dotfile. The =:auth= keyword arguments
   will be replaced by the credentials stored in your =~/.authinfo.gpg=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq rcirc-server-alist
      ;; This will replace :auth with the correct thing, see the doc for that function
      '(("freenode"
          :host "freenode.spacemacsserver.me"
          :port "1337"
          :auth "spacemacs_user/freenode"
          :channels ("#emacs"))
      ("geekshed"
          :host "geekshed.spacemacsserver.me"
          :port "1337"
          :auth "spacemacs_user/geekshed"
          :channels ("#jupiterbroadcasting"))))
   #+END_SRC

** Enabling =s/foo/bar/=
To configure rcirc to update buffers when people use =s/foo/bar/=, set the
variable =rcirc-enable-late-fix= to =t= in your dotfile:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
    (rcirc :variables rcirc-enable-late-fix t)))
#+END_SRC

** Enabling emojify-mode
To enable emojify-mode in rcirc buffers, set the variable =rcirc-enable-emojify=
to =t= in your dotfile:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
    (rcirc :variables rcirc-enable-emojify t)))
#+END_SRC

** Enabling erc-image
To enable erc-image for fetching and showing images when they are linked to in
chat, set the variable =rcirc-enable-erc-image= to =t= in your dotfile:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
    (rcirc :variables rcirc-enable-erc-image t)))
#+END_SRC

** Enabling erc-tweet
To enable erc-tweet for fetching and displaying tweets when they are linked in
chat, set the variable =rcirc-enable-erc-tweet= to =t= in your dotfile:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
    (rcirc :variables rcirc-enable-erc-tweet t)))
#+END_SRC

** Enabling erc-yt
To enable erc-yt for fetching and displaying previews for YouTube links in chat,
set the variable =rcirc-enable-erc-yt= to =t= in your dotfile:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
    (rcirc :variables rcirc-enable-erc-yt t)))
#+END_SRC

** Enabling rcirc-styles
To enable rcirc-styles for displaying and inserting color and text attribute
codes, set the variable =rcirc-enable-styles= to =t= in your dotfile:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
    (rcirc :variables rcirc-enable-styles t)))
#+END_SRC

* Rcirc documentation
The rcirc documentation can be found [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/rcirc.html][here]].

* Spacemacs Layout Support
RCIRC buffers are added automatically to the default layout for RCIRC controlled by
the variable =rcirc-spacemacs-layout-name= (defaults to "@RCIRC") and the default
binding ("i") is controlled by =rcirc-spacemacs-layout-binding=
