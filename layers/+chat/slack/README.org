* Description
This layer provides an interface to the Slack chat service via the emacs-slack
package. Where possible, this layer aims to reuse keybindings from the IRC
packages in Spacemacs.

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =slack= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

* Configuration

Follow the instructions in the [[https://github.com/yuya373/emacs-slack/blob/master/README.md][emacs-slack]] package for obtaining your client ID,
client secret, and token.

To test that everything is alright put the following snippet in your
=dotspacemacs/user-config()= replacing =client-id=, =client-secret= and =token=
with your info.

*Important* Do not keep private data in your dotfile. You can put your private
stuff elsewhere (like Dropbox for instance) and load the file in your dotfile.

  :client-id "my@email.address"

prefix.
