* Description
This layer provides an interface to the Slack chat service via the emacs-slack
package. Where possible, this layer aims to reuse key bindings from the IRC
packages in Spacemacs.

** Features:
- Real time messaging with [[https://github.com/ahyatt/emacs-websocket][emacs-websocket]]
- Connect to multiple slack instances
- Notifications with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/alert][alert.el]]

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =slack= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

* Configuration
Follow the instructions in the [[https://github.com/yuya373/emacs-slack/blob/master/README.md][emacs-slack]] package for obtaining your client ID,
client secret, and token.

To test that everything is alright put the following snippet in your
=dotspacemacs/user-config()= replacing =client-id=, =client-secret= and =token=
with your info.

*Important* Do not keep private data in your dotfile. You can put your private
stuff elsewhere (like Dropbox for instance) and load the file in your dotfile.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (slack-register-team
    :name "emacs-slack"
    :default t
    :client-id "my@email.address"
    :client-secret "mypassword"
    :token "token"
    :subscribed-channels '(general slackbot))
#+END_SRC

** Spacemacs layout integration
A [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/doc/DOCUMENTATION.org#layouts-and-workspaces][Spacemacs custom layout]] is defined by the layer. The name and the key binding
for it can be customized with the following layer variables:
- =slack-spacemacs-layout-name= for the layout name,
- =slack-spacemacs-layout-binding= for the key binding.

By default the values are:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
    (slack :variables slack-spacemacs-layout-name "@Slack"
                      slack-spacemacs-layout-binding "s")))
#+END_SRC
