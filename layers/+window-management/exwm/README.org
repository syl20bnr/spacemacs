* Description
Thanks to @ch11ng and his [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][EXWM]] project we can now use Emacs as our window
manager, that means that you can spawn a Browser Window, or your music player,
or anything.

** Features:
- Support for using Emacs as window manager

* Install
To use =exwm= layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=.

The default layer variables are:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
                '((exwm :variables exwm-enable-systray nil
                                   exwm-autostart-xdg-applications nil
                                   exwm-terminal-command "xterm"
                                   exwm-locking-command nil
                                   exwm-hide-tiling-modeline nil
                                   exwm-workspace-switch-wrap t
                                   exwm-randr-command nil)))
#+END_SRC

Please refer to [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/wiki][EXWM Wiki]] for setting up display manager.

** System Tray Integratios
To enable system tray integration, set =exwm-enable-systray= to =t=.

** XDG Autostart
If =exwm-autostart-xdg-applications= is non-nil, =.desktop= files in
=$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/autostart= and =XDG_CONFIG_DIRS= will be used to run applications at
startup. (See [[https://specifications.freedesktop.org/autostart-spec/autostart-spec-latest.html][Desktop Application Autostart Specification]] for details).

For the purpose of controlling whether an entry should be run under Emacs,
the =OnlyShowIn= and =NotShotIn= keys are checked for the string =EXWM=.

This is disabled per default.

* Key bindings
As other window managers the ~s~ or *Super* key (Windows Key) is the one that
is the prefix to every action. We'll use a lot of ~s~.

Some emacs keybindings are disabled in X Window, for example ~C-x~ and ~C-c~ are
disabled so that they can be used for Cutting and Copying text.
