* Description
This contribution layer adds Perspectives to Spacemacs. Perspectives are window
configurations that have buffer isolation between each other (under the keybinding ~SPC l b~).
At the beginning there is a ~@Home~ perspective which will contain all buffers by default.
Basically, staying in this perspective will feel as if you didn't have the perspectives layer enabled.
After creating the first perspective via the method you choose (~SPC l s~ or ~SPC l o custom-poersp~
or ~SPC l P~ for projectile perspectives). If you kill the ~@Home~ perspective ~SPC l k~,
you will also kill every buffer.

* Install

** Micro-states
*** Perspective Management Micro State

Prefix command for perspective management commands is ~SPC l~ (for Layout).

*** Custom Perspectives Micro State

The default bindings are the following:

| Key Binding | Description                                              |
|-------------+----------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC l o e~ | Emacs custom perspective                                 |
| ~SPC l o E~ | ERC custom perspective (needs the erc layer enabled)     |
| ~SPC l o i~ | RCIRC custom perspective (needs the rcirc layer enabled) |
| ~SPC l o o~ | Org custom perspective                                   |

You can of course add more custom perspectives by using the
~spacemacs|define-custom-perspective~ macro explained further below.

** Per project custom perpsective

Projectile will work normally in any perspectives by adding buffers to the current
perspective, but if you want to create a perspective specific to some project you
can use the ~SPC l P~.

** Save/Load perspectives into a file

With ~SPC l w~ and ~SPC l L~ you can save and load perspectives to a file this
is done without configuration, support is great for emacs 24.4, but depends on
=workgroups.el= for Emacs <= 24.3.

** Custom Perspective Macro
If you want to add a new custom-persp (for example if you want to have
IRC on its own perspective or maybe calendar or gnus) you have to use
the macro =spacemacs|define-custom-persp= as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (spacemacs|define-custom-persp "<name-to-be-shown-in-the-modeline>"
    :binding "<bind-key>"
    :body
    (...)
    (stuff to be done in the persp activating)
    (a major mode like twittering-mode or whatever)
    (...))
#+END_SRC

You can check out the layer's packages.el to see some examples of the
custom-perspectives. if you define something like this you may be able
to define a perspective with a layout.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (spacemacs|define-custom-persp "c++"
    :binding "+"
    :body
    (find-file "~/path/to/first/file.cpp")
    (split-window-right)
    (find-file "~/path/to/second/file.cpp")
    (... do more stuff but be careful not to destroy the universe ...))
#+END_SRC

Then you can access this persp with =SPC l o +=, where =+= is the binding.


** Predefined custom perspectives

*** Org-agenda custom perspective
Here we define a custom perspective that adds items to your org-agenda. If you
do not know what that is check the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/Agenda-commands.html][docs]].

The cool part is that you can have many org files with todos in the agenda and
with one simple command you can gather all the todos from all the agenda files
you have and show them in a single buffer. (in evil the command starts with ~;a~)

*** RCIRC/ERC custom perspective

Now you can also open IRC in a new perspective to keep all the chat buffers in
one perspective isolated from your work buffers.

You will have to use the perspective layer as well as the rcirc/erc layer:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(rcirc
                                                    erc
                                                    ;; you only need one of those layers
                                                    perspectives))
#+END_SRC

* Configuration
** Removing additional help

Once you know the key bindings to navigate between the workspaces you
may want to disable the exhaustive help in the workspace micro-state.
Set the variable =perspective-display-help= to =nil=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    '((perspectives :variables perspective-display-help nil)))
#+END_SRC
** Showing Spacemacs Home Buffer at Startup

If you changed stuff in your ~@Home~ perspectives, the state won't be reloaded 
each time you restart Emacs, each time the Home buffer will be shown. If you don't want
 to see the home buffer at startup change the value of ~spacemacs-persp-show-home-at-startup~.
