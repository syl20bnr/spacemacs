* Description
This layer adds [[https://i3wm.org/][i3wm]] like workspaces thanks to the [[https://github.com/wasamasa/eyebrowse][eyebrowse]] package.

Once the layer is activated a new number is added to the left side of the
mode-line. This number corresponds to the currently active workspace number.

At startup, the workspace number 1 is active. Switching to a workspace will
create it if it does not exist. For instance at startup you can press
~SPC l w 2~ to create the workspace 2.

The key bindings are registered in a transient-state displayed in the minibuffer.
The docstring of the transient-state displays the existing workspaces and the
currently active workspace has square brackets. Since this is a transient-state it
is possible to just preview a workspace, for instance press ~SPC l w 2~ to see
what's on the workspace 2 then press ~TAB~ to go back to the previously
activated workspace.

It is also possible to give a label to a the current workspace by pressing
~r~ in the transient-state.

* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =eyebrowse= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

** Removing additional help
Once you know the key bindings to navigate between the workspaces you
may want to disable the exhaustive help in the workspace transient-state.
Set the variable =eyebrowse-display-help= to =nil=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    '((eyebrowse :variables eyebrowse-display-help nil)))
#+END_SRC
