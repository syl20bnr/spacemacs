* Description

This layer is a drop-in replacement for the =vi-tilde-fringe= mode, for those
who desire behaviour closer to =vim='s.

It has better compatibility with retina displays, as it uses a text overlay
using your font, rather than a pixel-art tilde. The empty line indicators are
overlaid in within the buffer as in =vim=, and not in the fringe. The indicator
behaviour with trailing empty lines matches =vim='s behaviour.

For details, see the [[https://github.com/jmickelin/vim-empty-lines-mode][vim-empty-lines-mode]] repository.

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =vim-empty-lines= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.
