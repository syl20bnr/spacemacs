* Description
This layer replaces [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/evil-nerd-commenter][evil-nerd-commenter]] with [[https://github.com/linktohack/evil-commentary][evil-commentary]] for those
who prefer the behaviour of [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary][vim-commentary]].

- Use ~gcc~ to comment out a line (takes a count),
- ~gc~ to comment out the target of a motion (for example,
- ~gcap~ to comment out a paragraph), ~gc~ in visual
  mode to comment out the selection.

For more details see the [[https://github.com/linktohack/evil-commentary][evil-commentary]] repository.
