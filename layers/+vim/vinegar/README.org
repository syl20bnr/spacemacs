* Description
This layer is a port of vim-vinegar for emacs.

It is based on tpope’s [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar][vinegar.vim]], simplifying =dired=
with a limited number of details and exposing the ~-~ command in all
buffers to enter dired.

** Features:
- navigation up folders with ~-~ key
- simplify dired buffer to show only file names
- better evil/vim bindings for navigation within dired buffer
- keep only one active dired buffer
- Use dired-k extension to show time / vcs related information in
  single bar
- right mouse click moves up directory if in blank space or shows context menu

* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer add =vinegar= to the 
=dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list.

** Reuse dired buffer
To reuse dired buffers set the variable =vinegar-reuse-dired-buffer= to =t=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
    (vinegar :variables
             vinegar-reuse-dired-buffer nil))
#+END_SRC

** Deactive hide details mode
Per default extensive details in dired are hidden with this layer.
This can be deactivated by setting the variable =vinegar-dired-hide-details= to =nil=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
    (vinegar :variables
             vinegar-dired-hide-details t)))
#+END_SRC
