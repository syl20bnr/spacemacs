* Description
Layer for Vue, for working with =.vue= files.

Note: This layer creates a derived mode called =vue-mode= on the fly out of
=web-mode= to handle vue files. It will conflict with the [[https://github.com/AdamNiederer/vue-mode][vue-mode package]], make sure
you don't use that package together with this layer.

** Features:
- Wholesome features from =web-mode=, especially on template part
- Better performance
- On-the-fly syntax checking with =eslint=
- Proper syntax highlight and indentation with =vue-mode=
- Two options for backend support for autocompletion and code analysis: =lsp= and =dumb=
- Code autocompletion with =company-mode=
- Formatting code with =prettier= layer
- =evil-matchit= =%= to jump between open and close tags
- =emmet-mode= and =yasnippet= for code expanding with the =TAB= key

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =vue= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

The Vue layer uses the backend that's defined by the variable =vue-backend=. The options are =dumb=
and =lsp=. Default is =dumb= backend. To choose a default backend set the layer
variable =vue-backend=:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (vue :variables vue-backend 'lsp)
#+END_SRC

To use the on-the-fly syntax checking, install =eslint=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ npm install -g eslint-cli
#+END_SRC

Check eslint official doc for setting rules

To use automatic code formatting you need to install =prettier= with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ npm install -g prettier
#+END_SRC

If you want to use local =eslint= and =prettier= in your project, turn on node
 layer =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= function:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (node :variables node-add-modules-path t)
#+END_SRC

* Backends
** dumb
dumb backend is light weight and fast. =dumb-jump= is used to handled go to
definition (=gd= vim key binding). Because of the template nature of Vue, it
works very well. 

Company backend is set to be very eager in suggestions. 

=eslint= is used for linting.

** lsp
Vue language server needed to be installed 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ npm install -g vue-language-server
#+END_SRC

This backend provides all the fancy features like: jump to definition,
references, type inference... However, =eslint= is explicitly selected for
linting because it works better than =lsp= linter.

* Optional Configuration
~web-mode-script-padding~ is set to 0, so indent is zero at root level inside
~script~ tag

Same as =react= layer, you may refer to the =web-mode= configuration for fine
tuning the indenting behaviour.

For example, if you wan't two space indentation, put this in your
=dotspacemacs/user-config=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default
   ;; web-mode
   web-mode-markup-indent-offset 2
   web-mode-css-indent-offset 2
   web-mode-code-indent-offset 2
   web-mode-attr-indent-offset 2)
#+END_SRC

* Key bindings
** web-mode
Free stuff from `html' layer, with minor change to avoid conflict with =lsp= layer
