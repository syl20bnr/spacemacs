* Description
This layer brings in [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs][Treemacs]] to replace Neotree as the default file and project
explorer:

** Features:
An detailed overview over Treemacs' available features is available in [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs#detailed-feature-list][its
readme]]. In a short summary Treemacs offers the following:

- Simple and powerful navigation and ability to detail exactly how and where a
  file should be opened
- Good looking png icons.
- Ability to show tags contained in files. Tags are provided by imenu, so
  nearly every filetype is supported.
- Optionally fontifying files based on their git status.
- Optionally collapsing single-dir-child directories into one.
- Doing both asynchronously for an imperceptible performance cost.
- Optional =follow-mode= to automatically focus the currently selected file.
- Optional =filewatch-mode= to automatically refresh the view after (and only
  after) changes to the shown filesystem.

* Install
To use this layer, add =treemacs= to the existing
=dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= in your =dotspacemacs= file.

* Configuration
** Follow mode
To have treemacs automatically sync with your current buffer set the
layer variable =treemacs-use-follow-mode= to non-nil.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
    (treemacs :variables treemacs-use-follow-mode t)))
#+END_SRC

Default value is =t=.

** File watch
To automatically refresh the Treemacs buffer when there is a change in the
part of the file system shown by treemacs set the layer variable
=treemacs-use-filewatch-mode= to non-nil.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
    (treemacs :variables treemacs-use-filewatch-mode t)))
#+END_SRC

Default value is =t=.

** Collapsed directories
*This feature requires python to be installed*.

Treemacs tries to collapse empty directory names into one name. It is possible
to control how deep Treemacs will search for empty directories by settings the
layer variable =treemacs-use-collapsed-directories= to a positive number.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
    (treemacs :variables treemacs-use-collapsed-directories 3)))
#+END_SRC

Default value is 3 (or 0 when python is not installed).

| Key Binding | Description                                                                                                                                    |
|-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC 0~     | Open treemacs in the current directory. When not visiting a file use $HOME as fallback. With a prefix arg manually select the root instead.    |
| ~SPC f t~   | Hide/show existing treemacs buffer. Create one for the current directory if no buffer exists.                                                  |
| ~SPC f p~   | Same as ~SPC f t~, but when creating a new buffer open it in the current project's root.                                                       |
| ~SPC f P~   | Open treemacs in the current project's root. With a prefix arg manually select the project instead.                                            |
| ~SPC f B~   | Find and select a bookmark. If it cannot be found rebuild view with the bookmark's location as root. Also open the bookmark with a prefix arg. |
| ~SPC f C-t~ | Manually focus the treemacs view on the currently selected file. Not needed when =treemacs-follow-mode= is enabled.                            |
| ~M-0~       | Selected the treemacs window. Actually selects window #10, which is always assigned to treemacs.                                               |

** Inside Treemacs
Treemacs will use either ~j/k~ or ~n/p~ to go to the next/previous line,
depending on whether vim/hybrid editing style is used. Likewise refresh is only
bound to g when emacs editing style is used, since under vim g is a prefix for
many other commands.

| ~ov~        | Open current file or tag by vertically splitting next-window. Stay in current window with a prefix argument.                          |
