* Description
=counsel-gtags=, =helm-gtags= and =ggtags= are clients for GNU Global. GNU
Global is a source code tagging system that allows querying symbol locations in
source code, such as definitions or references. Adding the =gtags= layer enables
both of these modes.

** Features:
- Select any tag in a project retrieved by gtags
- Resume previous helm-gtags session
- Jump to a location based on context
- Find definitions
- Find references
- Present tags in current function only
- Create a tag database
- Jump to definitions in file
- Show stack of visited locations
- Manually update tag database
- Jump to next location in context stack
- Jump to previous location in context stack
- Jump to a file in tag database
- Enables =eldoc= in modes that otherwise might not support it.
- Enables =company complete= in modes that otherwise might not support it.

* Install
** GNU Global (gtags)
To use gtags, you first have to install [[https://www.gnu.org/software/global/download.html][GNU Global]].

You can install =global= from the software repository of your OS; however, many
OS distributions are out of date, and you will probably be missing support for
=pygments= and =exuberant ctags=, and thus support for many languages. We
recommend installing from source.

*** Install on Ubuntu
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo apt-get install global
#+END_SRC

*** Install on OSX using Homebrew
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install global --with-pygments --with-ctags
#+END_SRC

*** Install on *nix from source
**** Install recommended dependencies
To take full advantage of global you should install 2 extra packages in
addition to global: pygments and ctags (exuberant). You can do this using
your normal OS package manager, e.g. on Ubuntu

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags python-pygments
#+END_SRC

or e.g. Archlinux:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo pacman -S ctags python-pygments
#+END_SRC

**** Install with recommended features
Download the latest tar.gz archive, then run these commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  tar xvf global-<version>.tar.gz
  cd global-<version>
  ./configure --with-exuberant-ctags=/usr/bin/ctags
  make
  sudo make install
#+END_SRC

**** Configure your environment to use pygments and ctags
To be able to use =pygments= and =ctags=, you need to copy the sample
=gtags.conf= either to =/etc/gtags.conf= or =$HOME/.globalrc=. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cp gtags.conf ~/.globalrc
#+END_SRC

Additionally you should define GTAGSLABEL in your shell startup file e.g.
with sh/ksh:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  echo export GTAGSLABEL=pygments >> .profile
#+END_SRC

With fish:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  echo export set -x GTAGSLABEL pygments >> ${HOME}/.config/fish/config.fish
#+END_SRC

*** Conflict between =ctags= and emacs's =etags= binary
If you installed =emacs= from source after =ctags=, your original =ctags= binary
is probably replaced by emacs's =etags=. To get around this you will need to
configure =emacs= as following before installing:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./configure --program-transform-name='s/^ctags$/ctags.emacs/'
#+END_SRC

To check if you have the correct version of =ctags= execute:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ctags --version | grep Exuberant
#+END_SRC

If there is no output you have the wrong =ctags= executable and you need to
reinstall =ctags= from your package manager.

** Emacs Configuration
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs= file. You
will need to add =gtags= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
        '( ;; ...
          gtags
           ;; ...
          ))
#+END_SRC

*** Disabling by default
If =ggtags-mode= is too intrusive you can disable it by default, by setting the
layer variable =gtags-enable-by-default= to =nil=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    '((gtags :variables gtags-enable-by-default t)))
#+END_SRC

This variable can also be set as a file-local or directory-local variable for
additional control on a per project basis.

* Usage
Before using =gtags=, remember to create a GTAGS database by one of the following
methods:
- From within Emacs, run either =counsel-gtags-create-tags= or
  =helm-gtags-create-tags=, which are bound to ~SPC m g C~. If the language is
  not directly supported by GNU Global, you can choose =ctags= or =pygments= as
  a backend to generate the database.
- From inside a terminal:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cd /path/to/project/root

  # If the language is not directly supported and GTAGSLABEL is not set
  gtags --gtagslabel=pygments

  # Otherwise
  gtags
#+END_SRC

** Language Support
*** Built-in languages
If you do not have =ctags= or =pygments= enabled gtags will only produce
tags for the following languages:
- asm
- c/c++
- java
- php
- yacc

*** Exuberant ctags languages
If you have enabled =exuberant ctags= and use that as the backend
(i.e. =GTAGSLABEL=ctags= or =--gtagslabel=ctags=) the following additional languages
are supported:
- c#
- erlang
- javascript
- common-lisp
- emacs-lisp
- lua
- ocaml
- python
- ruby
- scheme
- vimscript
- windows-scripts (.bat .cmd files)

*** Universal ctags languages
If you have installed [[https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags][universal ctags]] and use that as the backend
(i.e. GTAGSLABEL=ctags or --gtagslabel=ctags) the following additional
languages are supported:
- clojure
- d
- go
- rust

*** Pygments languages (plus symbol and reference tags)
In order to look up symbol references for any language not in the built in
parser you must use the pygments backend. When this backend is used global
actually uses both ctags and pygments to find the definitions and uses of
functions and variables as well as "other symbols".

If you enabled pygments (the best choice) and use that as the backend
(i.e. =GTAGSLABEL=pygments= or =--gtagslabel=pygments=) the following additional
languages will be supported:
- elixir
- fsharp
- haskell
- octave
- racket
- scala
- shell-scripts
- tex

** Eldoc integration
This layer also integrates =ggtags= for its Eldoc feature. That means, when
writing code, you can look at the minibuffer (at the bottom) and see variable
and function definitions of the symbol under point. However, this feature is
only activated for languages which are not:
- C
- C++
- Common Lisp
- Emacs Lisp
- Python
- Ruby

Since these modes have better Eldoc integration already.

In addition =gtags= commands are also supported for symbols in the
=compile=, =shell-command= and =async-shell-command= buffers.
