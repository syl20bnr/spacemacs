* Description

Many GNOME applications like gnome-terminal have options to set dark color
theme. Emacs doesn't have this possibility, so Emacs dark themes with light
GNOME window borders look bad. This layer solves it, but only for initial frame.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Gnome 3's default theme Adwaita has support for both light and dark window
decorations. Many media apps like Totem use the dark theme. It puts the focus
on the content and it's easier on the eyes.

Emacs with a dark theme and the large white-ish window decoration isn't really a
fit on my desktop, but that can be easily fixed using a bit of elisp with xprop!

** TODO Fix: It's working only for first frame (first launch of spacemacs)

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =dark-window= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.
