* What is this?
This simple contribution layer is an example. It installs around 100 themes
for Emacs. You can try them easily by invoking helm-themes with: ~SPC T s~.

You can see samples of all included themes in this [[http://themegallery.robdor.com][theme gallery]] from [[http://www.twitter.com/robmerrell][Rob Merrell]].

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =themes-megapack= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.
