;; Variables

(defvar colors-colorize-identifiers nil
  "If `variables' colorize variables, if `all' colorize all identifiers in
programming language buffers.")

(defvar colors-enable-nyan-cat-progress-bar nil
  "If non nil all nyan cat packages are enabled (for now only `nyan-mode').")

;; IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRIBUTORS:
;; Do not edit these defaults. Let the user change them if they really want to.
;; These defaults are carefully balanced statistical averages of all colors suitable
;; for both light and dark themes, and perfected to work for 90% of all themes.
;; It's the BEST out-of-the-box experience we can offer without forcing all users
;; to write their own individual per-theme optimizations for ALL of their themes...

(defvar colors-default-rainbow-identifiers-sat 50
  "The rainbow-identifiers saturation value to use for themes that lack per-theme settings.")

(defvar colors-default-rainbow-identifiers-light 65
  "The rainbow-identifiers lightness value to use for themes that lack per-theme settings.")

;; PER-THEME CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME:
;; Guideline: Aim at a saturation and lightness level that matches the average
;; look of the theme, so that it looks balanced against the theme's own colors.
