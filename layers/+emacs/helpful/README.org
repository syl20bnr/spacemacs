* Description
This layer replaces the existing emacs related help buffers with more detailed ones.

** Features:
- Better help buffers with [[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][helpful]] for emacs related buffers
- Source code shown implicitly in help buffer for all lisp objects
- More detailed descriptions in the emacs specific function, variable and key help buffers
- Better formatted elisp docstrings

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =helpful= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

* Key bindings
This layer aims to silently replace the standard emacs help key bindings
with improved versions. So it does not introduce new bindings.
For the sake of completion you can find below all keys which are replaced
by this layer.
