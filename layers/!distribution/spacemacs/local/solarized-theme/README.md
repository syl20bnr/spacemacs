## Solarized for Emacs

Solarized for Emacs is an Emacs port of the [Solarized theme for vim](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized),
developed by Ethan Schoonover.

Solarized for Emacs is tested only under Emacs 24, but should be
working under Emacs 23 as well. The theme is implemented in terms of
customizations and `deftheme` and does not require the
`color-theme-package`.

## Installation

Solarized for Emacs is available for installation via the
[MELPA](http://melpa.org) and
[Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) `package.el`
repositories. Assuming you've set one of the them up (I recommend
MELPA) you can install solarized like this:

`M-x package-install solarized-theme`

Afterwards - business as usual, just load one of the theme variants with `M-x
load-theme`.

(If you want to install manually that procedure is briefly documented in the
FAQ at the end of this document.)

## Customisations

### Theme specific settings

If you don't like low-contrast modeline or fringe, you can `customize` them
either by doing `M-x customize-group solarized` or setting the values using
elisp code:

```el
;; make the fringe stand out from the background
(setq solarized-distinct-fringe-background t)

;; make the modeline high contrast
(setq solarized-high-contrast-mode-line t)

;; Use less bolding
(setq solarized-use-less-bold t)

;; Use more italics
(setq solarized-use-more-italic t)

;; Use less colors for indicators such as git:gutter, flycheck and similar.
(setq solarized-emphasize-indicators nil)

;; Don't change size of org-mode headlines (but keep other size-changes)
(setq solarized-scale-org-headlines nil)

;; Avoid all font-size changes
(setq solarized-height-minus-1 1)
(setq solarized-height-plus-1 1)
(setq solarized-height-plus-2 1)
(setq solarized-height-plus-3 1)
(setq solarized-height-plus-4 1)

```

Note that these need to be set **before** `load-theme` is invoked for Solarized.

### Underline position setting for X

If you are using Emacs under X you might like the following setting which puts
the underline below the
[font bottomline instead of the baseline](https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/pseries/v5r3/topic/com.ibm.aix.graPHIGS/doc/phigstrf/figures/afma5rbd.jpg).

Imho it enhances the general readability and also it fits well with the default
`solarized-high-contrast-mode-line` setting which uses an slightly emphazised
underline for the modeline to create one horizontal window border in the same
manner as the vertical border.

```el
(setq x-underline-at-descent-line t)
```

## FAQ

### Stand-alone manual installation

Save the following files in a folder that's on your Emacs' `load-path`:

* [dash.el](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magnars/dash.el/master/dash.el) - [dash](https://github.com/magnars/dash.el), a modern list library for Emacs
* [solarized.el](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs/master/solarized.el) - the solarized theme

Save the following files into `~/.emacs.d/themes`:

* [solarized-light-theme.el](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs/master/solarized-light-theme.el)
* [solarized-dark-theme.el](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs/master/solarized-dark-theme.el)

Add this your `.emacs.d`:

```el
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes")
```

Now you can load the theme with the interactive function `load-theme`.
