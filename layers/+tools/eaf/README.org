* Description
  This layer adds support for the [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework][Emacs Application Framework (EAF)]].

** Features:
  - Browse using a full-fledged browser within Emacs
  - PDF viewer (with continuous scroll)
  - Video player
  - Image viewer
  - See [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework#launch-eaf-applications][EAF documentation]] for many more features

* Install
  To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
  add =eaf= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
  file.

  Subsequently install the required dependencies with =SPC SPC
  eaf-install-dependencies=. This command only works for Ubuntu and Fedora based
  distributions. Users of Arch (based) distributions can run the script manually
  in their terminal. If the script does not work for you then [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework#dependency-list][install the
  required dependencies manually]].

* Usage

** Configuring keybindings
   Configuration of EAF keybindings works in a different way than normally in Spacemacs.
   
   Also EAF, and additionally this layer, implement some tricks that are
   required to make leader keys in EAF buffers behave as expected in Spacemacs.
   Therefore it is recommended to keep these default (major-mode-)leader
   keybindings.
   
   For information about configuration of other key bindings for EAF, see [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework/wiki/Keybindings][here]]. 

   If you do want to modify the leader keys, then information about the tricks
   implemented in this layer can be found [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework/issues/498][here]] and [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework/pull/500][here]].
