* Description
This layer adds support for the [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework][Emacs Application Framework (EAF)]].

** Features:
- Browse using a full-fledged browser within Emacs
- PDF viewer (with continuous scroll)
- Video player
- Image viewer
- See [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework#launch-eaf-applications][EAF documentation]] for many more features

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =eaf= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

Subsequently install the required dependencies with =SPC SPC
  eaf-install-dependencies=. This command only works for Ubuntu and Fedora based
distributions. Users of Arch (based) distributions can run the script manually
in their terminal. If the script does not work for you then [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework#dependency-list][install the
required dependencies manually]].

* Usage
** Configuring key bindings
Configuration of EAF key bindings works in a different way than normally in Spacemacs.

Also EAF, and additionally this layer, implement some tricks that are
required to make leader keys in EAF buffers behave as expected in Spacemacs.
Therefore it is recommended to keep these default (major-mode-)leader
keybindings.

For information about configuration of other key bindings for EAF, see [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework/wiki/Keybindings][here]]. 

If you do want to modify the leader keys, then information about the tricks
implemented in this layer can be found [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework/issues/498][here]] and [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework/pull/500][here]].

* Key bindings
Except for the few Spacemacs specific modifications listed below, all EAF
keybindings are documented [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework/wiki/Keybindings][here.]]

Use ~SPC t k m~ to [[https://develop.spacemacs.org/doc/DOCUMENTATION.html#which-key-persistent][show the EAF key bindings persistently in which-key]], or use
~SPC h d K~ to show the `eaf-mode-map` in a separate buffer.
