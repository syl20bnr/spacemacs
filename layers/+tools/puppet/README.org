* Description
This layer provides support for the Puppet DSL to Spacemacs.

** Features:
- Syntax highlighting via [[https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-mode][puppet-mode]]
- Syntax-checking via [[http://puppet-lint.com/][puppet-lint]]
- Navigation commands to jump between blocks
- Applying the content of the current manifest directly from emacs

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =puppet= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

To get syntax checking to work you will also need to install =puppet-lint= by executing:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ gem install puppet-lint
#+END_SRC

* Key bindings
The following key bindings are available in Puppet Mode:
