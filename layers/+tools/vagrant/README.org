* Description
This layer adds support for working with Vagrant using [[https://github.com/ottbot/vagrant.el][vagrant.el]] and
[[https://github.com/dougm/vagrant-tramp][vagrant-tramp]].

** Features:
- Manage boxes (under the ~SPC a V~ prefix)
- Remote editing on Vagrant boxes via Tramp

* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =vagrant= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

*Note:* Since vagrant files are written in =ruby= it is recommended
to install the =ruby= layer as well.

** Vagrant
Follow the [[https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/index.html][Installing Vagrant]] and [[https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/index.html][Getting Started]] guides in
Vagrant’s documentation.

** Testing
If you’d like to test this layer out in a simple way (for example to
make sure you have Vagrant configured correctly) there is a [[https://gist.github.com/anonymous/578279337caf180298cd91c61be995bc][Vagrantfile]]
in this directory.
