* Description
This layer adds support [[https://cmake.org/][CMake]] scripts.

** Features:
- Support for CMake configure/build (with limited support for other build systems),
  automatic generation of =compile_commands.json= (compile flags), on-the-fly configuration
  of flycheck, company-clang and RTags (if installed) with [[https://github.com/atilaneves/cmake-ide][cmake-ide]] .
- Run selected test using =Helm= interface via =helm-ctest=.

* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =cmake= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

** CMake-ide configuration
To enable CMake projects support set the layer variable =cmake-enable-cmake-ide-support=
to =t= in the dotfile:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    '((cmake :variables cmake-enable-cmake-ide-support t)))
#+END_SRC

=cmake-ide= plugin has several useful configuration options.

To configure project you need to create =.dir-locals.el= file. In case of using
make as CMake backend you can use =helm-make= to select required build target.

Here is a sample configuration. This configuration forces =cmake-ide= to use the
local directory and pass that directory to =helm-make=. Such config allows to
build your project with ~SPC c c~ key binding.

Additionally it's possible to configure =helm-ctest= in the same way via defining ~helm-ctest-dir~.
Trailing slash is required.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ((nil .
        ((cmake-ide-project-dir . "~/Project")
         (cmake-ide-build-dir . "~/Project/build")
         (cmake-ide-cmake-opts . "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug")
         (helm-make-build-dir . "build")
         (helm-make-arguments . "-j7")
         (helm-ctest-dir . "~/Project/build/")
         )))
#+END_SRC

| ~SPC m p c~ | Run CMake and set compiler flags for auto-completion and flycheck       |
| ~SPC m p C~ | Run CMake if compilation database JSON file is not found                |
| ~SPC m p d~ | Remove file connected to current buffer and kill buffer, then run CMake |
| ~SPC m p t~ | Run CTest                                                               |
