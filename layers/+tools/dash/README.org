* Description
+*This layer works only on OS X for the moment*+
- [[http://kapeli.com/dash][dash]] :: Is a great tool for quick access to various sets of documentation,
          only available in OS X.

- [[https://github.com/stanaka/dash-at-point][dash-at-point]] :: Is the package used to integrate =dash= in Emacs. It will try
                   to intelligently guess specific docsets to use based off of
                   your current mode.

- [[http://zealdocs.org/][zeal]] :: Zeal is an offline documentation browser inspired by Dash,
          available for Linux and Windows.

- [[https://github.com/jinzhu/zeal-at-point][zeal-at-point]] :: Run zeal-at-point to search the word at point (or string in
                   region), then Zeal is launched and search the word. Use
                   prefix argument C-u to edit the search string first.

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =dash= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

** Dash (OS X)

You have to install [[http://kapeli.com/dash][dash]] on your machine.

It is recommended to set the =HUD mode= in your Dash application preferences
when using this layer. 

** Zeal (Linux & Windows)

You have to install [[http://zealdocs.org/][zeal]] on your machine.

Then install the docsets you use more frequently

** Check Documentation for x-at-point

See the documentation [[https://github.com/stanaka/dash-at-point#Usage][dash-at-point-usage]] , or [[https://github.com/jinzhu/zeal-at-point][zeal-at-point]] for more
information on customizing specific docsets for modes.

* Key bindings

| Key Binding | Description                                                     |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC d d~   | Lookup thing at point in Dash or Zeal                           |
| ~SPC d D~   | Lookup thing at point in Dash or Zeal within a specified Docset |
| ~SPC d h~   | Lookup thing at point in helm-dash                              |
| ~SPC d H~   | Lookup thing at point in helm-dash within a specified Docset    |

** helm-dash
=dash-at-point= is linked to the GUI app and is only available for OSX. On
linux, you can use =zeal-at-point= which is linked to the GUI app too, but it's
open source.

Or you can use [[https://github.com/areina/helm-dash][helm-dash]] instead, it requires no app. You can use
=dash/helm-dash-docset-newpath= to set the location path of your docsets.

* TODOs

** DONE Check zeal
CLOSED: [2015-06-12 Fri 16:30]
[[http://zealdocs.org/][zeal]] is an open source alternative to dash with Emacs integration available.

** TODO Make helm-dash use zeal or dash docsets by default.
