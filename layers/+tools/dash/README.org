          only available in OS X.

- [[https://github.com/stanaka/dash-at-point][dash-at-point]] :: Is the package used to integrate =dash= in Emacs. It will try
                   to intelligently guess specific docsets to use based off of
                   your current mode.

- [[http://zealdocs.org/][zeal]] :: Zeal is an offline documentation browser inspired by Dash,
          available for Linux and Windows.

- [[https://github.com/jinzhu/zeal-at-point][zeal-at-point]] :: Run zeal-at-point to search the word at point (or string in
                   region), then Zeal is launched and search the word. Use
                   prefix argument C-u to edit the search string first.

* Key bindings

| Key Binding | Description                                                     |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC d d~   | Lookup thing at point in Dash or Zeal                           |
| ~SPC d D~   | Lookup thing at point in Dash or Zeal within a specified Docset |
| ~SPC d h~   | Lookup thing at point in helm-dash or counsel-dash              |
| ~SPC d H~   | Lookup in helm-dash or counsel-dash within a specified Docset   |

** helm-dash and counsel-dash
=dash-at-point= is linked to the GUI app and is only available for OSX. On
linux, you can use =zeal-at-point= which is linked to the GUI app too, but it's
open source.

Or you can use [[https://github.com/areina/helm-dash][helm-dash]] when using =helm= and [[https://github.com/nathankot/counsel-dash][counsel-dash]] when using =ivy=,
which requires no additional application. You can use
=dash/helm-dash-docset-newpath= to set the location path of your docsets.
