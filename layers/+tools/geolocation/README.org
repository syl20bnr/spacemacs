* Description
This layer offers location sensitive adjustments to Emacs.

** Features:
- Supports the following adjustments:
  - Automatic switching between light (day) and dark (night) themes via [[https://github.com/hadronzoo/theme-changer][theme-changer]]
  - Local weather forecast via [[https://github.com/aaronbieber/sunshine.el/blob/master/sunshine.el][sunshine]]
  - Integration with OS X’s CoreLocation service via [[https://github.com/purcell/osx-location][osx-location]]
  - Manual location setting via variables in your dotfile

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =geolocation= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in
this file.

All services are disable by default. To enable all, or some of them, add instead
something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (geolocation :variables
               geolocation-enable-automatic-theme-changer t
               geolocation-enable-location-service t
               geolocation-enable-weather-forecast t)
#+END_SRC

* Configuration
** Location
Set location manually by setting the following variables in your dotfile:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq calendar-location-name "Barcelona, Spain"
        calendar-latitude 41.23
        calendar-longitude 1.80)
#+END_SRC

** OSX-location
Mac users can take adavantage of automatic geogrphical discovery using the OS’s
CoreLocation system service, implemented as a long running background process.
In order to enable it, set =geolocation-enable-location-service= to =t= as
explained in installation instructions.

A helper script will need to be given proper access first time this layer is
activated.

** Theme-changer
This layer implement a simple “theme changer” which, when enabled, will switch
between first two themes the user has setup in ~dotspacemacs-themes~. First
theme listed will be used as the light variant, while the second as the dark.
Other themes will be ignored by this layer, though they are still available for
cycling, etc.

Note that =theme-changer= *requires* location to be set.

** Sunshine (weather forecast)
Sunshine display local weather forecast.

Setup [[https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in][OpenWeatherMap]] API key. Set ~sunshine-appid~ to some hash string from the
openweathermap website. You need to sign up to the website to get a API key.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq sunshine-appid "your-apikey")
#+END_SRC

Configure your location by setting the variable sunshine-location. You can
provide a string, like “New York, NY” or a ZIP code, like “90210”. This variable
is available through the Customize facility.

When specifying a ZIP code, you may receive results from a foreign country. This
is due to weird behavior from OpenWeatherMap. To resolve this, append a comma
and the country code after the ZIP code. Note the lack of a space in the example
below.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq sunshine-location "90210,USA")
#+END_SRC

It will use the imperial unit system by default. To switch to metric, add
~sunshine-units 'metric~ to the variables list for this layer, or add this.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq sunshine-units 'metric)
#+END_SRC

Weather forecast icons are disabled by default, and can be toggled by pressing
`i’ within this mode’s main buffer.

To display weather forecast icons by default (“pretty mode”), add
~sunshine-show-icons t~ to the variables list for this layer, or add this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq sunshine-show-icons t)
#+END_SRC
