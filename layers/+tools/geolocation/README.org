* Description
This layer offers few location sensitive adjustment to Emacs, such as
automatically switching between light (day) and dark (night) themes, weather
forecast and on OS X, also automatic tracking of location, using OS X's
CoreLocation services.

** Supported packages in this layer
- [[https://github.com/aaronbieber/sunshine.el/blob/master/sunshine.el][sunshine]]
- [[https://github.com/purcell/osx-location][osx-location]]

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =geolocation= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

All services are disable by default. To enable all, or some of them, add instead
something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (geolocation :variables
               geolocation-enable-automatic-theme-changer t
               geolocation-enable-location-service t
               geolocation-enable-weather-forecast t)
#+END_SRC

* Configuration
** Location
Set location manually by setting the following variables to the
=dotspacemacs/user-config= function of your dotfile:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq calendar-location-name "Barcelona, Spain"
        calendar-latitude 41.23
        calendar-longitude 1.80)
#+END_SRC

On OS X, all of these variables get setup automatically if the ~osx-location~
service was enabled (Wifi must be turned on to make it work). In this case, if
~calendar-location-name~ was omitted, it'll be stringed-up ~calendar-latitude~
and ~calendar-longitude~ i.e. "41.23, 1.80".

** theme-changer
This layer implement a simple "theme changer" which, when enabled, will switch
between first two themes the user has setup in ~dotspacemacs-themes~. First
theme listed will be used as light variant, while the second as the the dark.
Other themes will be ignored by this layer, though they are still available for
cycling, etc.

** sunshine (weather forecast)
Sunshine display local weather forecast.

Setup [[https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in][OpenWeatherMap]] API key.
Set ~sunshine-appid~ to some hash string from the openweathermap
website. You need to sign up to the website to get a API key.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq sunshine-appid "your-apikey")
#+END_SRC

Configure your location by setting the variable sunshine-location. You
can provide a string, like "New York, NY" or a ZIP code, like "90210".
This variable is available through the Customize facility.
  When specifying a ZIP code, you may receive results from a foreign
country. This is due to weird behavior from OpenWeatherMap. To resolve
this, append a comma and the country code after the ZIP code. Note the
lack of a space in the example below.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq sunshine-location "90210,USA")
#+END_SRC

It will use the imperial unit system by default. To switch to metric, add
~sunshine-units 'metric~ to the variables list for this layer, or add this.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq sunshine-units 'metric)
#+END_SRC

Weather forecast icons are disabled by default, and can be toggled by pressing
`i' within this mode's main buffer.

To display weather forecast icons by default ("pretty mode"), add
~sunshine-show-icons t~ to the variables list for this layer, or add this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq sunshine-show-icons t)
#+END_SRC

** osx-location
OS X users can take adavantage of automatic geogrphical discovery using the OS'
CoreLocation system service, implemented as a long running background process. A
helper script will need to be given proper access first time this layer is
activated.
