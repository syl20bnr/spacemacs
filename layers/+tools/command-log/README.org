* Description
This layer adds handy commands for demonstrating Spacemacs.

** Features:
- Support for logging all entered keys and triggered commands in a designated buffer via [[https://github.com/lewang/command-log-mode][command-log-mode]].
- Experimental support for logging the last command directly in the mode line via [[https://github.com/tarsius/keycast][keycast]].
- Provides the best way to demonstrate the connection between keystrokes and commands in Emacs.
- Provides an easy way to create command logs for training classes.

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =command-log= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

* Command log
This is the default way to demonstrate Spacemacs commands. It works by opening a new
buffer which logs all executed commands in the current window.

* Keycast
This is an experimental addition to this layer which will show the last
used keystroke and command in the modeline. However as we support multiple
modelines it may require some tweaking of =keycast-mode-line-insert-after= which will
be defaulted to =%e= for now.

If you have a working configuration for your modeline feel free to share it
with the rest of the project.
