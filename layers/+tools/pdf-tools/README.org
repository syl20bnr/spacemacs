* Description
   This layer enables support for the [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools][=pdf-tools=]] package.
   
According to the official repository, "PDF Tools is, among other things, a
replacement of DocView for PDF files. The key difference is, that pages are not
pre-rendered by e.g. ghostscript and stored in the file-system, but rather
created on-demand and stored in memory."

Examples of features that =pdf-tools= provides:
- Use =occur= in the pdf file;
- Show all headings in a outline buffer;
- Manipulate annotations.

* Install
** Prerequisites
Linux is the only operating system officially supported, but it's possible to
use =pdf-tools= on OS X as well, and possibly on other Unix flavors.

You'll need to install a few libraries. Check the [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools#server-prerequisites][instructions]] on
=pdf-tools= page. Note that compiling from source might not be necessary, as
the documentation states.

If you use a Debian based system such as Ubuntu, you can skip this step, as
=pdf-tools= installation asks whether you want it to try to download
automatically all dependencies using ~apt-get~.


** Dotfile
After installing the dependencies, add this to your =~/.spacemacs=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(pdf-tools))
#+end_src

After that, syncronize your configuration with ~SPC f e R~. This will pop up a
window showing the compilation process.

If everything goes right, the compilation won't display any error and you will
be able to see /PDFView/ (instead of /DocView/) on the spaceline after opening a
pdf file.

If the compilation run successfully but you get 
~Error (use-package): pdf-tools :config: No executable `epdfinfo' found~,
try restarting Spacemacs ([[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools/issues/31][issue]]).

If the compilation does not run successfully, you should confirm whether all
dependencies are properly installed and run the command ~pdf-tools-install~.

* Usage
Use ~M-SPC~ or ~s-M-SPC~ to activate the pdf-tools transient state.
The keybindings that the transient displays can be also accessed using ~SPC m~. The
navigation keybindings can be used directly.


Try out opening the outline (~O~). The outline window shows the structure of the
pdf, displaying all headings.

You can set annotations by selecting regions and right clicking on the buffer.
Additionally, all annotation related functions are can be accessed with ~SPC m a~.

Searching with =occur= can be done by using =pdf-occur= (~SPC m s s~).

Tips:
- You'll probably want to use =pdf-view-set-slice-from-bounding-box= (bound to
  ~SPC m s b~) This command trims the blank parts of the
  lateral margins, making the useful portion larger.
- The last visited page is not saved across Emacs sessions. If you want save it,
  use the bookmarks commands =bookmark-set= (~C-x r m~) and =bookmark-jump=
  (~SPC j b~) to save and go to a bookmark, respectively.
 

* Known Issues 
Due to =image-mode='s behaviour, the =pdf-tools= buffer might go back to the
first page after switching windows. If this happens, you can quickly go back to
the previous page in history with =pdf-history-backward= (~``~ in Evil state and
~B~ in Emacs state.)

* Key bindings
If you use Emacs editing style, check the key bindings at the [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools#some-keybindings][pdf-tools page]].

/For evil users/: Note that the search keys activate =isearch=, which works
differently from the default Evil search. To go to the next match, use ~C-s~.
