* Description
This layer brings in [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs][Treemacs]] to replace Neotree as the default file and project explorer:

[[file:img/treemacs.png]]

** Features:
An detailed overview over Treemacs' available features is available in [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs#detailed-feature-list][its readme]]. In a short summary Treemacs offers
the following:

 * Simple and powerful navigation and ability to detail exactly how and where a file should be opened
 * Good looking png icons.
 * Ability to show tags contained in files. Tags are provided by imenu, so nearly every filetype is supported.
 * Optionally fontifying files based on their git status.
 * Optionally collapsing single-dir-child directories into one.
 * Doing both asynchronously for an imperceptible performance cost.
 * Optional follow-mode to automatically focus the currently selected file.
 * Optional filewatch-mode to automatically refresh the view after (and only after) changes to the shown filesystem.

* Installation
To use this layer, add =treemacs= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= in your =dotspacemacs= file.
In addition you can also specify the following configuration variables:

 * =treemacs-use-follow-mode=
   When t =treemacs-follow-mode= will be enabled.
   Default value: t
 * =treemacs-use-filewatch-mode=
   When t =treemacs-filewatch-mode= will be enabled.
   Default value: t
 * =treemacs-use-collapsed-directories=
   Maximum number of single-dir-child directories Treemacs will collapse into one.
   Default value: 3

 Using all 3 options the =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= will look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (treemacs
   :variables
   treemacs-use-follow-mode t
   treemacs-use-filewatch-mode t
   treemacs-use-collapsed-directories 3)
#+END_SRC

* Configuration
A detailed list of all possible configuration options can be found in [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs#configuration][Treemacs' readme]]. You can also look at
~M-x customize-group treemacs~.

| Key Binding | Description                                                                                                                                    |
|-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC f t~   | Hide/show existing treemacs buffer. Create one for the current directory if no buffer exists.                                                  |
| ~SPC f T~   | Open treemacs in the current directory. When not visiting a file use $HOME as fallback. With a prefix arg manually select the root instead.    |
| ~SPC f p~   | Same as ~SPC f t~, but when creating a new buffer open it in the current project's root.                                                       |
| ~SPC f P~   | Open treemacs in the current project's root. With a prefix arg manually select the project instead.                                            |
| ~SPC f B~   | Find and select a bookmark. If it cannot be found rebuild view with the bookmark's location as root. Also open the bookmark with a prefix arg. |
| ~SPC f C-t~ | Manually focus the treemacs view on the currently selected file. Not needed when =treemacs-follow-mode= is enabled.                            |
| ~M-0~       | Selected the treemacs window. Actually selects window #10, which is always assigned to treemacs.                                               |

** Inside Treemacs
Treemacs will use either j/k or n/p to go to the next/previous line, depending on whether vim/hybrid editing style is used.
Likewise refresh is only bound to g when emacs editing style is used, since under vim g is a prefix for many other commands.
