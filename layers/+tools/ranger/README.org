* Description
This layer brings Ranger features to spacemacs from the =ranger= package.

To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =ranger= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

To default with preview enabled when entering ranger:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
                '(ranger :variables
                         ranger-show-preview t))
#+END_SRC

** Features:
- use ranger to display dired with ranger like preview and stacked parent windows.

* Configuration
Most parameters can be toggled on and off and stay within the current emacs
session. Any settings that are desired on startup should be set below.

** Customizing
You toggle the use of =-= to enter ranger with `ranger-enter-with-minus`.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq ranger-enter-with-minus t)
#+END_SRC

When disabling the mode you can choose to kill the buffers that were opened
while browsing the directories.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq ranger-cleanup-on-disable t)
#+END_SRC

Or you can choose to kill the buffer just after you move to another entry in the
dired buffer.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq ranger-cleanup-eagerly t)
#+END_SRC

You can choose to show dotfiles at ranger startup, toggled by =zh=

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq ranger-show-hidden t)
#+END_SRC

Define custom function used to output header of primary ranger window. Must
return a string that is placed in the header-line.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq ranger-header-func 'ranger-header-line)
#+END_SRC

Define custom function used to output header of parent and preview windows. Must
return a string that is placed in the header-line.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq ranger-parent-header-func 'ranger-parent-header-line)
#+END_SRC

** Parent options
You can set the number of folders to nest to the left, adjusted by =z-= and =z+=

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq ranger-parent-depth 2)
#+END_SRC

You can set the size of the parent windows as a fraction of the frame size

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq ranger-width-parents 0.12)
#+END_SRC

When increasing number of nested parent folders, set max width as fraction of
frame size to prevent filling up entire frame with parents.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq ranger-max-parent-width 0.12)
#+END_SRC

** Preview options
You can choose to show previews literally, or through find-file, toggled by =zi=

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq ranger-show-literal t)
#+END_SRC

You can set the size of the preview windows as a fraction of the frame size

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq ranger-width-preview 0.55)
#+END_SRC

You probably donâ€™t want to open certain files like videos when using preview. To
ignore certain files when moving over them you can customize the following to
your liking:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq ranger-ignored-extensions '("mkv" "iso" "mp4"))
#+END_SRC

To set the max files size (in MB), set the following parameter:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq ranger-max-preview-size 10)
#+END_SRC
