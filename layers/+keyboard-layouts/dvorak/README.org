* Description
This layer changes the key bindings in spacemacs to be
[[http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/][dvorak programmer]] friendly. =dvorak programmer= is an optimized keyboard layout
focused in programming and it's a variant of the more general =dvorak= (us)
keyboard layout. The main changes on this layer are the navigation keys, ~hjkl~
to ~htns~ (as you can see, located in the home row). As this changes affect a
lot of packages, this layer needs to deal with some corrections and swappings.

* Install
To use this contribution add it to your =~/.spacemacs=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(dvorak))
#+end_src

It is possible to modify wether some features are loaded or not through the
setting of this two variables:

- dvorak-set-enabled-configurations
- dvorak-set-disabled-configurations

The first one will list all the features to activate (nil default to /all/) and
the second will list the features *not* to load. Note that the second takes
precedence over the first, thus, if a feature is listed in both lists, it will
*not* be loaded.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
              '((dvorak :variables dvorak-set-disabled-configurations '(eyebrowse org))))
#+END_SRC

* Configurations
The available configurations are:

- avy
- ace-window
- helm
- buffer-move
- comint-mode
- company
- elfeed
- evil
- evil-escape
- evil-surround
- evil-evilified-state
- evil-window
- eyebrowse
- ivy
- magit
- org
- ranger
- spacemacs

* Mapping
The mapping correction doesn't follow any standard more than the current
=evil-dvorak= package's keybindings. This layer tries to keep the rule as
generic as possible and remap everything based on the same criteria.

The main rebindings are done in the movement keys, thus corresponding:

- ~h -> h~
- ~j -> t~
- ~k -> n~
- ~l -> s~

And when a conflict is found the functionality is just swapped, so we'll find
the lost functions on ~t~ under ~j~.

There are also other remappings between evil commands, such as replacing ~a~
with =evil-first-non-blank=. This keybindings don't affect anything outside evil
base keybindings, so they need no correction. To see further information on
this, see =evil-dvorak= package README.
* Key bindings
This layer tries to remap keybindings automatically, thus making its
documentation hard. As a general overview, we tried to keep as much consistency
as possible, and always keeping the main keybindings in the home row fingers. 

However, to see the basic keybindings rules, see the [[https://github.com/AlejandroCatalina/evil-dvorak][evil-dvorak]] keybindings.
