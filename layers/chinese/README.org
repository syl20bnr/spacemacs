* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =chinese= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

** Configuration
*** Configure the Default Input Method(配置默认中文输入法)
The default Chinese input method is =Chinese-pyim=, if you are a Wubi(五笔) user, 
you could set the variable =chinese-default-input-method= to =wubi=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
    (chinese :variables chinese-default-input-method 'wubi)))
#+end_src

*** Configure the =Chinese-pyim= Input Method(配置中文拼音输入法)
When the first time you use =Chinese-pyim=, you should install the lexicon(词库)
file. You could call =pyim-dicts-manager= to open up the settings buffer and
press =i e= to install the default lexicon. The lexicon is about 20M, so you
should be patient when downloading starts. After the lexicon file is downloaded,
just press =s= to save and =R= to restart configuration.
*** Enable fcitx
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '((chinese :variables
                                                             chinese-enable-fcitx t)))
#+END_SRC
If you don’t need to type Chinese in minibuffer, you could temporarily disable fcitx in minibuffer
with the following configuration.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (fcitx-aggressive-setup)
#+END_SRC
**** Requirement
***** Linux
You need use this with =fcitx= and make sure =fcitx-remote= is in your search path.

***** Mac OS X
We don't have a =fcitx= in OS X yet but we already added an emulation called
=fcitx-remote= to make you happy with other Chinese input-methods.

You can install [[https://github.com/CodeFalling/fcitx-remote-for-osx][fcitx-remote-for-osx]] from homebrew.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  brew install fcitx-remote-for-osx --with-input-method=baidu-pinyin
#+END_SRC

=--with-input-method=baidu-pinyin= means install for Baidu-pinyin Input Method.

You can use =brew info fcitx-remote-for-osx= to get more options info for input
method support.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
--with-input-method=
  Select input method: baidu-pinyin(default), baidu-wubi, sogou-pinyin, qq-wubi, squirrel-rime, osx-pinyin
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** Windows
=fcitx.el= doesn't support Windows for now.

*** Enable YouDao(有道) Dictionary(激活有道字典)
The YouDao Dictionary is disabled by default, if you want enable it.
You should set =chinese-enable-youdao-dict= to =t=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '((chinese :variables
                                                             chinese-enable-youdao-dict t)))

#+END_SRC

*** Set monospaced font size(设置等宽字体）
If you are mixing Chinese words with English words, the text is not perfectly
aligned in org table. That's because normally the Chinese font size is not equal
to the English font size. You could call =spacemacs//set-monospaced-font= with
your own Chinese font name in =dotspacemacs/user-config= function.

Example configuration:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Note: The Hiragino Sans GB is bundled with MacOS X. 
;; If you are not using MacOS X, you should change it to another Chinese font name.
(spacemacs//set-monospaced-font   "Source Code Pro" "Hiragino Sans GB" 14 16)
#+END_SRC

*** Enable/Disable ace-pinyin in =avy-goto-char=
You can use =avy-goto-char= with pinyin supported by default, if you want to
disable it.You can set =chinese-enable-avy-pinyin= to =nil=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '((chinese :variables
                                                             chinese-enable-avy-pinyin nil)))
#+END_SRC

* Key Bindings
Currently, there are no built-in key bindings for this layer. You could define
your own preference.

Here are a few suggested key bindings (remember that ~SPC o~ is reserved for
personal usage, spacemacs won´t put any binding under this prefix):

** Youdao Dictionary
Bind ~SPC o y~  to =youdao-dictionary-search-at-point+=.

** Find-by-pinyin-dired
Bind ~SPC o d~ to =find-by-pinyin-dired=
