* Description

  This layer hooks [[https://github.com/amperser/proselint][proselint]] into flycheck to making typing go good, obviously.

  While flycheck-proselint is enabled (via the toggle or the config var), it
  will take precedence and be the ONLY functioning flycheck checker. Toggling
  it off will return the normal flycheck functioning to the buffer.

  It is possible to manually change this behavior using the
  `flycheck-add-next-checker` function.

* Install

Install the proselint executable. Make sure it is in your $PATH.

#+begin_src sh
  pip install proselint
#+end_src

Add the following to your =~/.spacemacs=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(prose))
#+end_src

By default, proselint is not started immediately in buffers. You can change this
behavior by setting the `prose-proselint-enable-by-default` variable to non-nil.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(prose :variables
                                                          prose-proselint-enable-by-default t))
#+end_src

** Running a flycheck checker everywhere

   Flycheck only allows one checker to be run, without explicitly setting the
   the next checker that will be run. Emacs-Lisp mode runs 3 elisp checkers by
   knowing ahead of time what checkers they are and then defining them via the
   `flycheck-add-next-checker` function (describe that function for more info).
   Because the proselint checker can be run in all modes, we cannot anticipate
   and set the next-checker, which means that we can have to run the proselint
   checker by itself.
