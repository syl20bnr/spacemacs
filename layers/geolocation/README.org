* Description
This layer offers few location sensitive adjustment to Emacs, such as
automatically switching between light (day) and dark (night) themes, weather
forecast and on OS X, also automatic tracking of location, using OS X's
CoreLocation services.

** Supported packages in this layer
- [[https://github.com/hadronzoo/theme-changer][theme-changer]]
- [[https://github.com/aaronbieber/sunshine.el/blob/master/sunshine.el][sunshine]]
- [[https://github.com/purcell/osx-location][osx-location]]

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =geolocation= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

All services are disable by default. To enable all, or some of them, add instead
something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (geolocation :variables
               geolocation-enable-osx-location-service-support t
               geolocation-enable-weather-forecast t
               geolocation-enable-automatic-theme-changer t)
#+END_SRC

* Configuration
** Location
To set location manually, add something like this inside the ~dotspacemacs/config
defun~. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq calendar-location-name "Barcelona, Spain"
        calendar-latitude 41.23
        calendar-longitude 1.80)
#+END_SRC

On OS X, all of these variables get setup automatically by the ~osx-location~
service, when enabled. If ~calendar-location-name~ was omitted, it'll be
stringed-up like so: "41.23, 1.80".

** theme-changer
Theme changer will switch between the first two themes the user has setup in
~dotspacemacs-themes~, depending on time at geographical location.

** sunshine (weather forecast)
Sunshine uses the imperial unit system by default. To switch to metric, do this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq sunshine-units 'metric)
#+END_SRC

Weather forecast icons are disabled by default, but can be toggled by pressing
`i' within this mode's main buffer. To display weather forecast icons by default
("pretty mode"), change the settings to this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq sunshine-show-icons t)
#+END_SRC

** osx-location
OS X users can take adavantage of automatic geogrphical discovery using the OS'
CoreLocation system service, implemented as a long running background process. A
helper script will need to be given proper access first time this layer is
activated.
