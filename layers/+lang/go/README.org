* Description
This layer adds extensive support for go.

** Features:
- gofmt/goimports on file save
- Auto-completion using [[https://github.com/nsf/gocode/tree/master/emacs][go-autocomplete]] (with the =auto-completion= layer)
- Source analysis using [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Y9xCEMj5S-7rv2ooHpZNH15JgRT5iM742gJkw5LtmQ][go-guru]]
- Refactoring with [[http://gorefactor.org/][godoctor]]
- Linting with flycheck's built-in checkers or flycheck-gometalinter
- Coverage profile visualization

* Install
** Pre-requisites
You will need =gocode=, =godef= and =godoctor=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  go get -u -v github.com/nsf/gocode
  go get -u -v github.com/rogpeppe/godef
  go get -u -v golang.org/x/tools/cmd/guru
  go get -u -v golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gorename
  go get -u -v golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports
#+END_SRC

If you wish to use =gometalinter= set the value of =go-use-gometalinter= to t:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (go :variables go-use-gometalinter t)
#+end_src

and install the tool:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  go get -u -v github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter
  gometalinter --install --update
#+END_SRC

For more information read [[https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter/blob/master/README.md][gometalinter README.md]]
and [[https://github.com/favadi/flycheck-gometalinter/blob/master/README.md][flycheck-gometalinter README.md]]

If you wish to use =godoctor= for refactoring, install it too:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  go get -u -v github.com/godoctor/godoctor
  go install github.com/godoctor/godoctor
#+END_SRC

Make sure that the =gocode= executable is in your PATH. For information about
setting up =$PATH=, check out the corresponding section in the FAQ (~SPC h f
$PATH RET~).

For best results, make sure that the =auto-completion= and =syntax-checking=
layers are enabled as well.

** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =go= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

* Configuration

By default, go buffers are run through =gofmt= on save. To use a different
formatter, set the value of =gofmt-command=, e.g.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq gofmt-command "goimports")
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (go :variables gofmt-command "goimports")
#+end_src

** Indentation
By default, the tab width in Go mode is 8 spaces. To use a different value set
the layer variable =go-tab-width=, e.g.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (go :variables go-tab-width 4)
#+end_src

** Tests
If you're using =gocheck= in your project you can use the
=go-use-gocheck-for-testing= variable to enable suite testing and to get single
function testing to work.

=go-coverage-display-buffer-func= controls how =go-coverage= should display
the coverage buffer. See [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Choosing-Window.html][=display-buffer=]] for a list of possible functions.
The default value is =display-buffer-reuse-window=.

Tests are run in a compilation buffer displayed in a popup window that can be
closed by pressing ~C-g~ from any other window. The variable
=go-test-buffer-name= can be customized to set the output buffer name.

To provide additional arguments to go test, specify =go-use-test-args=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (go :variables go-use-test-args "-race -timeout 10s"
#+end_src

** Guru
Go Oracle has been deprecated as of October 1, 2016, it's replacement is =go-guru=.

If you would like to use the =goguru= bindings in your work, you will need to
install it, and in your project you will need to set the scope with ~SPC m f o~.
The scope is a comma separated set of packages, and =go='s recursive operator is
supported. In addition, you can prefix with =-= to exclude a package from
searching.

In addition, =GOPATH= must be set prior to =go-guru= initialization.

** Autocomplete
=gocode= uses the output from installed binary files to provide its suggestions.
You have a few options to ensure you always get up to date suggestions:

- Run =go install ./...= in your package directory when you make a file change.
- Run =gocode set autobuild true= to have gocode attempt to run =go install
  ./...= for you.
- You can configure your task runner to run =go install ./...= command on every
  file change.
