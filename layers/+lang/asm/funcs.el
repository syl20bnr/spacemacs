;; when we press ':' character, it runs `asm-colon' command in asm-mode.
;; The command automatically removes the indentation ofcurrent line, since
;; every non-whitespace character before a colon is a label in asm and
;; label has to be at the beginning of a line. However, the problem is
;; that when deleting indentation, trailing spaces are left between the
;; colon and the original point the colon was inserted.
;;
;; These functions solve that problem. First, check whether we have any
;; space or tab after point. If so, don't do anything becuase the spaces are
;; there intentionally. If not, we delete all trailing spaces between
;; point and colon.
