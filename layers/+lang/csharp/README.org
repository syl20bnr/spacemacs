* Description
This layer adds support for C# language using the [[https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn][omnisharp-roslyn]] language
server and corresponding [[https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-emacs][omnisharp-emacs]] package.

Please report any issues encountered to [[https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-emacs/issues][omnisharp-emacs issue page on github]].
PRs are welcome too!

** Features:
- Syntax checking with flycheck (when =syntax-checking= layer is used)
- Support for auto-completion (when =auto-completion= layer is used)
- Refactoring
- Navigation to cross-references
- Inspecting types in metadata

* Packages Included
- [[https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-emacs][omnisharp]]

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =csharp= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

Before you can work with C# files you will need to install the server by invoking
~SPC m s i~ (or =M-x omnisharp-install-server=). Otherwise, if this fails for
you, please see [[https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-emacs/blob/master/doc/server-installation.md][omnisharp-emacs/doc/server-installation.md]].

The server needs to be started manually with ~SPC m s s~ (or with
=M-x omnisharp-start-omnisharp-server=). It will prompt a path to your .cpsroj
or .sln file. In the future the server will be started automatically however for
now this is required.

* Caveats
- You should use =dotnet= CLI tool from [[https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core][.NET Core download page]] or an IDE like
  Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio to manage solution and project files.
- Debugging on command line is possible using [[https://github.com/mono/sdb][SDB]].
- There can be *only one server* running at the same time. To switch to a different
  solution/project you need to invoke ~SPC m s S~ and ~SPC m s s~ to stop
  current server and start another one pointing to another solution/project.

* Key Bindings
