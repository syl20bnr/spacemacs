* Description
This layer adds experimental support for C# language using [[https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-emacs][OmniSharp]].

* Packages Included
- [[https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-emacs][OmniSharp-emacs]]

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =csharp= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

** Prerequisites
*** ASP.NET 5
Follow the instructions for your platform [[https://github.com/aspnet/home#user-content-get-started][here]].

*** curl
You'll need [[https://curl.haxx.se/][curl]] to be able to use the Omnisharp package. Use your favorite
package manager to install it (on Windows you can use [[https://chocolatey.org/][chocolatey]]).

Be sure to make the =curl= binary available to your PATH environment variable,
or set the variable =omnisharp--curl-executable-path= in your dotfile function
=dotspacemacs-config=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default omnisharp--curl-executable-path "/PATH/TO/CURL/curl")
#+END_SRC

*** Omnisharp server
You have to compile the OmniSharp server following the instructions which can
be found [[https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-server][here]].

Don't forget to add the server binary directory to your system PATH environment
variable. The full path the binary can also be directly referenced in the
variable =omnisharp-server-executable-path= (put this in your
=dotspacemacs-config= function):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default omnisharp-server-executable-path "/PATH/TO/OMNISHARP/OmniSharpServer")
#+END_SRC

OmniSharp should now automatically load and start a server when you open a
=.cs= file.

* Caveats
- It's currently not possible to create a C# solution outside of an IDE such as
  [[http://www.monodevelop.com/][MonoDevelop]], it's therefore recommended that you install it to create your
  solutions.

- Debugging is possible using [[https://github.com/mono/sdb][SDB]].
