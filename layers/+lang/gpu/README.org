* Description
This layer provides support for GPU related languages like shading and computing languages.
This includes files ending in:
- =.cl= (OpenCL)
- =.cu= (CUDA)
- =.cuh= (CUDA)
- =.fsh= (Shaders)
- =.vsh= (Shaders)
- =.glsl= (Shaders)
- =.vert= (Shaders)
- =.frag= (Shaders)
- =.geom= (Shaders)
-
Also this layer provides completion for =.vert=, =.tesc=, =.tese=, =.geom=,
=.frag= and =.comp= shaders via =company-glsl= when [[https://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/tools/Reference-Compiler/][=glslangValidator=]] can be
found on your system and =auto-completion= layer is enabled. Note that
completion is [[https://github.com/Kaali/company-glsl][rather simple]].

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =gpu= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.
