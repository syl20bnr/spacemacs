* Description
This layer adds support for [[https://flowtype.org/][flow]] to spacemacs.

** Features:
- Syntax highlighting
- Linting
- Code-completion
- Eldoc integration for flow-types
- Compilation

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =flow-type= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list.

In addition you also need to flow binary installed best with npm like shown below.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  npm install -g flow-bin
#+END_SRC

The type under the cursor is shown automatically using eldoc. You may find this
a little sluggish, depending on your setup - if so, you can disable it by setting
=flow-type-enable-eldoc-type-info= to =nil=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (flow-type :variables flow-type-enable-eldoc-type-info nil)
#+END_SRC

You can always show types manually using =flow-minor-type-at-pos=,
bound to =SPC m f t= by default.
