* Description
  This layer makes editing ttl and n3 files in Spacemacs more fun!
  It includes:
- syntax highlighting
- auto-indent
- clickable URIs
  The layer is almost entirely comprised of the fantastic https://bitbucket.org/nxg/ttl-mode. Great work, nxg.

* Install
  To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
  add =ttl= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
  file.
  Then, open a .ttl file of your choosing!

* Key bindings

  This layer doesn't expose any key bindings.
