* Description
This layer adds basic support for the Forth family of languages to spacemacs.

** Features:
- Syntax highlighting
- Showing meaning of objects in context of the current =Forth= session.
- Eval of entire files or regions in current =Forth= session.
- Passing interactive commands to current =Forth= session.

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =forth= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

A local installation of =Forth= needs to be present as well. =GNU Forth= is
commonly available on Unix systems via the package manager. To bypass the query
when calling ~run-forth~, the default Forth can be configured by setting the
appropriate variable.

  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
                '((forth :variables forth-executable "gforth")))
