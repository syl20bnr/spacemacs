* Description
The layer adds ReStructuredText (ReST) support to Spacemacs and adds some
functions to =rst-mode=.

Note: to add =Sphinx= specific support use the layer =sphinx=.

** Features:
- =rst= files are supported via Emacs built-in =rst.el=.
- Lists are inserted by new functions.
- Directives can be inserted easily.
- auto-completion for directives and options via =auto-complete-rst=.
- snippet support via =yasnippet=.

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =restructuredtext= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list
in this file.

* Configuration
** Auto-complete
For now =auto-complete-rst= only works with sphinx 1.4.9 and lower.
New 1.5 release (as from December 2016) is not yet supported.
