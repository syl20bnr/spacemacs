* Description
This layer adds support for Apple's Swift programming language, used as a
general purpose scripting language.

** Features:
- Auto-completion (with the =lsp= layer and [[https://github.com/swiftlang/sourcekit-lsp][sourcekit-lsp]])
- Syntax checking with =flycheck= (available with the =syntax-checking= layer)
- Syntax highlighting with [[https://github.com/swift-emacs/swift-mode][swift-mode]]
- Indentation
- Code navigation using =imenu= (built-in)

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =swift= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

* Configuration
All layer configurations can be done by setting layer variables in your dotfile.
No custom user config lines are necessary

** Choosing a backend
This layer heavily relies on sourcekit-lsp to support proper IDE support.
If the lsp layer is not available no auto-completion can be provided.

*** LSP
For proper IDE support this backend should be used. It is
based on an external server which will be started automatically
by emacs, once a swift file is opened. The key bindings are
the same for all lsp modes so if you are already familiar with
one you should be able to work the same in all modes.

To set explicitly do the following in your dotfile:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (swift :variables
          swift-backend 'lsp
          swift-lsp-executable-path "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/sourcekit-lsp")
#+END_SRC

If this var is not set it will be set to =lsp= if the =lsp layer= is loaded.

For the system to work you will also need
the latest version of the lsp server from [[https://github.com/swiftlang/sourcekit-lsp][sourcekit-lsp]] or directly from your =Xcode= installation.
The path to the server executable must be given in the layer
variable =swift-lsp-executable-path=.

NOTE: Key bindings for LSP are defined in the
LSP layer. Also it is advisable to have a look
at the autocomplete layer for an optimal
intellisense config for LSP.

*** No lsp
In this case no specific config is necessary, but autocompletion will not be available.

** Validation steps
First check that you are able to run this from the command line:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  xcrun swift
#+END_SRC

Then validate that your lsp server is available under the given path if you are using lsp.

** REPL integration
Unless configured by the user, the REPL will be invoked using the command
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  xcrun swift
#+END_SRC

You can launch the REPL directly from emacs with using the key binding ~SPC m s s~ (or ~C-c C-z~).
The universal prefix ~SPC u~ (~C-u~) may be used to modify command invocation.

* Key bindings
** REPL

| Key bindings | Description                                                  |
|--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC m '~    | =swift-mode-run-repl= will run or switch to an existing REPL |
| ~SPC m s s~  | =swift-mode-run-repl= will run or switch to an existing REPL |
| ~SPC m s b~  | Send the current buffer to the repl                          |
| ~SPC m s r~  | Send the current region to the repl                          |

** In REPL Mode

| Key bindings | Description                 |
|--------------+-----------------------------|
| ~SPC m s s~  | swift-repl-mode-switch-back |
| ~C-c C-z~    | swift-repl-mode-switch-back |
