* Description
Alda is a music composition language allowing music to easily be written and
edited in a text file.

This layer adds key bindings for =alda-mode='s functions, which allow Alda code
to be interpreted and played by the running Alda server. It will also start the
Alda server if it is not running.

** Features:
- Syntax highlighting for Alda files.
- Play portions of a buffer, or the entire buffer,
  through a running Alda server.

* Install
Add =alda= to the =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in =~/.spacemacs=.
You will also want to ensure that you have installed [[https://github.com/alda-lang/alda/releases][Alda]] so that =alda-mode=
can play your code.

* Key bindings
When alda-mode is active in an Alda file, you can use these key bindings:

| Key binding | Description                     |
|-------------+---------------------------------|
| ~SPC m b~   | Play the entire buffer          |
| ~SPC m c~   | Play block (paragraph on point) |
| ~SPC m r~   | Play region (selected text)     |
| ~SPC m n~   | Plays the current line          |

Note that if the Alda server is not running, =alda-mode= will start the server,
and you will have to run the command again.
