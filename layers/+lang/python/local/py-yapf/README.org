Provides commands, which use the external =yapf= tool to tidy up the current buffer according to Python's PEP8.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/google/yapf.git
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paetzke/py-yapf.el/master/py-yapf.el \
       -O /your/path/py-yapf.el
#+END_SRC

You can also install =py-yapf= with /MELPA/:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
M-x package-install RET
py-yapf RET
#+END_SRC

Add the save hook to your =~/.emacs=

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/your/path/")
(require 'py-yapf)
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'py-yapf-enable-on-save)
#+END_SRC

Now every time you save your Python file =yapf= will be executed on the current buffer.
