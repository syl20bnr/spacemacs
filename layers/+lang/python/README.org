* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =python= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

** Test runner
Both =nose= and =pytest= are supported. By default =nose= is used.
To choose your test runner set the layer variable =python-test-runner= to
either =nose= or =pytest=.

The root of the project is detected with a =.git= directory or a =setup.cfg= file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
  '((python :variables python-test-runner 'pytest)))
#+END_SRC

** Anaconda dependencies
=anaconda-mode= tries to install the dependencies itself but sometimes
it does not work and you may encounter the following message when
opening a python buffer:

#+begin_example
    Blocking call to accept-process-output with quit inhibited!!
#+end_example

To fix this, install the =anaconda-mode= [[https://github.com/proofit404/anaconda-mode/blob/master/requirements.txt][anaconda-deps]] by hand:

#+begin_src sh
    pip install  jedi==0.8.1 json-rpc==1.8.1 service_factory==0.1.2
#+end_src

Source: https://github.com/proofit404/anaconda-mode#issues

If you are facing errors such as "Unable to run anaconda-mode server", try
setting your ~PYTHONPATH~ as explained at
https://github.com/proofit404/anaconda-mode#pythonpath

** Automatic buffer formatting on save
To enable automatic buffer formatting on save with  [[https://github.com/google/yapf][YAPF]] set the variable
=python-enable-yapf-format-on-save= to =t=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
    (python :variables python-enable-yapf-format-on-save t)))
#+END_SRC

** autoflake
To be able to suppress unused imports easily, install [[https://github.com/myint/autoflake][autoflake]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pip install autoflake
#+END_SRC

** pylookup
To use =pylookup= on ~SPC m h H~, make sure you update the database first, using
~SPC SPC pylookup-update~.

* Management of Python versions and virtual environments

** Manage virtual environments with pyvenv
A virtual environment provides isolation of your Python package versions. For a
general overview see [[http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/][this site]]. [[http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html][Virtualenvwrapper]] which is also explained in the
previous link, is a program which manages your virtual environments in a central
location set by the ~WORKON_HOME~ environment variable.

Spacemacs integration of virtual environments and virtualenvwrapper is provided
by the [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/pyvenv][pyvenv]] package. It provides the following keybindings:

| Key Binding | Description                                     |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC m V a~ | activate a virtual environment in any directory |
| ~SPC m V d~ | deactivate active virtual environment           |
| ~SPC m V w~ | work on virtual environment in ~WORKON_HOME~    |

** Manage multiple Python versions with pyenv
If you need multiple Python versions (e.g. Python 2 and Python 3) then take a
look at [[https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv][pyenv]]. It enables the installation and managment of multiple
Python versions.
[[https://www.brianthicks.com/2015/04/10/pyenv-your-python-environment-automated/][This blogpost]] gives a good overview on how to use the tool. Spacemacs
integration is provided by [[https://github.com/proofit404/pyenv-mode][pyenv mode]] which has the following keybindings.

| Key Binding | Description                          |
|-------------+--------------------------------------|
| ~SPC m v s~ | set a pyenv environment with [[https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv][pyenv]]   |
| ~SPC m v u~ | unset a pyenv environment with [[https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv][pyenv]] |

Pyenv can also manage virtual environments for each of the Python versions it
has installed. Those will be listed alongside your Python versions.

*** Automatic activation of local pyenv version
A project-specific pyenv version may be written to a file called
=.python-version= using the [[https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-local][pyenv local]] command.

Spacemacs can search in parent directories for this file, and automatically set
the pyenv version. The behavior can be set with the variable
=python-auto-set-local-pyenv-version= to:
- =on-visit= (default) set the version when you visit a python buffer,
- =on-project-switch= set the version when you switch projects,
- =nil= to disable.

* Key Bindings

** Inferior REPL process
Start a Python or iPython inferior REPL process with ~SPC m s i~.
If =ipython= is available in system executable search paths, =ipython=
will be used to launch python shell; otherwise, default =python=
interpreter will be used.  You may change your system executable
search path by activating a virtual environment.

Send code to inferior process commands:

| Key Binding | Description                                     |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC m s b~ | send buffer and keep code buffer focused        |
| ~SPC m s B~ | send buffer and switch to REPL in insert mode   |
| ~SPC m s f~ | send function and keep code buffer focused      |
| ~SPC m s F~ | send function and switch to REPL in insert mode |
| ~SPC m s i~ | start inferior REPL process                     |
| ~SPC m s r~ | send region and keep code buffer focused        |
| ~SPC m s R~ | send region and switch to REPL in insert mode   |
| ~CTRL+j~    | next item in REPL history                       |
| ~CTRL+k~    | previous item in REPL history                   |

** Running Python Script in shell
To run a Python script like you would in the shell press ~SPC m c c~
to start the Python script in comint mode. This is useful when working with
multiple Python files since the REPL does not reload changes made in other
modules.

| Key Binding | Description                                                               |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC m c c~ | Execute current file in a comint shell                                    |
| ~SPC m c C~ | Execute current file in a comint shell and switch to it in =insert state= |

*Note:* With the universal argument ~SPC u~ you can enter a new
compilation command.

** Testing
Test commands start with ~m t~:
