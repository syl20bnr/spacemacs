* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =python= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

** Choosing a backend
To choose a default backend set the layer variable =python-backend=:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (python :variables python-backend 'anaconda)
#+END_SRC

Alternatively the =lsp= backend will be automatically chosen if the layer =lsp=
is used and you did not specify any value for =python-backend=.

Backend can be chosen on a per project basis using directory local variables
(files named =.dir-locals.el= at the root of a project), an example to use the
=lsp= backend:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  ;;; Directory Local Variables
  ;;; For more information see (info "(emacs) Directory Variables")

  ((python-mode (python-backend . lsp)))
#+END_SRC

*Note:* you can easily add a directory local variable with ~SPC f v d~.

The available options are:

| symbol    | description               |
|-----------+---------------------------|
| 'anaconda | Default                   |
| 'lsp      | python-lsp-server package |

* Backends
** Anaconda
=anaconda-mode= tries to install the dependencies itself but sometimes
it does not work and you may encounter the following message when
opening a python buffer:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Blocking call to accept-process-output with quit inhibited!!
#+END_EXAMPLE

To fix this, install the =anaconda-mode= [[https://github.com/proofit404/anaconda-mode/wiki][anaconda-deps]] by hand:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pip install --upgrade "jedi>=0.13.0" "json-rpc>=1.8.1" "service_factory>=0.1.5"
#+END_SRC

If you encounter problems with Jedi 1.0 consider downgrading to 0.13.0. See [[https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/873][this
issue]] for details.

Source: [[https://github.com/proofit404/anaconda-mode#issues]]

If you are facing errors such as "Unable to run anaconda-mode server", try
setting your =PYTHONPATH= as explained at
[[https://github.com/proofit404/anaconda-mode#pythonpath]]

** Language Server Protocol
The =lsp= backend can use either of the following language server implementations:

| symbol   | description                         |
|----------+-------------------------------------|
| 'pylsp   | [[https://pypi.org/project/python-lsp-server/][python-lsp-server package]] (default) |
| 'pyright | [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-pyright][Microsoft pyright language server]]   |

=pylsp= is default value for =python-lsp-server=, an example for use =pylsp=:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (python :variables python-backend 'lsp)
#+END_SRC

To use the Microsoft pyright language server, set the =python-lsp-server= layer
variable as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (python :variables python-backend 'lsp python-lsp-server 'pyright)
#+END_SRC

*** python-lsp-server
You need to install python language server:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pip install python-lsp-server
#+END_SRC

You may also be interested in installing all optional dependencies with

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pip install 'python-lsp-server[all]'
#+END_SRC

For more information on optional dependencies, as well as 3rd-party plugins, see
[[https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server][python-lsp-server repository]].

If you've installed the language server and related packages as development
dependencies in a pipenv environment, you'll want to set the ~python-pipenv-activate~
config variable to ~t~. This activates your pipenv before enabling the
lsp backend. The same applies for ~python-poetry-activate~.

*** Microsoft pyright language server
[[https://github.com/microsoft/pyright][Pyright]] is a language server by Microsoft rewritten from scratch. It can be
installed via pip, yarn or npm as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # via pip
  pip install pyright
  # or via yarn
  yarn global add pyright
  # or via npm
  npm install -g pyright
#+END_SRC

* Additional tools
** Syntax checking
Syntax checking uses =flake8= package:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pip install flake8
#+END_SRC

** Test runner
Both =nose= and =pytest= are supported. By default =nose= is used.
To choose your test runner set the layer variable =python-test-runner= to
either =nose= or =pytest=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    '((python :variables python-test-runner 'pytest)))
#+END_SRC

If you need both then you can set =python-test-runner= to a list like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    '((python :variables python-test-runner '(pytest nose))))
#+END_SRC

This means that =pytest= is your primary test runner. To use the secondary test
runner you can call the test functions with a prefix argument e.g. ~SPC u SPC m
t t~ to run one test with =nose=.

To set project specific test runners you can set =python-test-runner= in a
directory local variable in your project root. ~SPC f v d~ in Spacemacs. See
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html][the official documentation]] for more information.

The root of the project is detected with a =.git= directory or a =setup.cfg= file.

** Buffer formatting
One of [[https://github.com/google/yapf][YAPF]] (the default), [[https://github.com/ambv/black][black]] or =lsp= may be selected as the formatter, via
=python-formatter=, as =yapf=, =black= or =lsp= respectively.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
    (python :variables python-formatter 'yapf)))
#+END_SRC

Alternatively the =lsp= formatter will be automatically chosen if the layer =lsp=
is used and you did not specify any value for =python-formatter=.

The key binding ~SPC m =~ invokes the selected formatter on the current buffer
when in non LSP python mode otherwise ~SPC m ==~ is used.

Note that a specific formatter may also be invoked unconditionally via
=yapfify-buffer=, =blacken-buffer= or =lsp-format-buffer=, provided
these are installed.

** Automatic buffer formatting on save
To enable automatic buffer formatting on save set the variable
=python-format-on-save= to =t=. The formatter specified by =python-formatter=
will be used.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
    (python :variables python-format-on-save t)))
#+END_SRC

** Automatic save of buffer when testing
By default a buffer is automatically saved before tests are executed upon it,
you can disable this feature by setting =python-save-before-test= to =nil=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
    (python :variables python-save-before-test nil)))
#+END_SRC

** autoflake
To be able to suppress unused imports easily, install [[https://github.com/myint/autoflake][autoflake]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pip install autoflake
#+END_SRC

** pylookup
To use =pylookup= on ~SPC m h H~, make sure you update the database first, using
~SPC SPC pylookup-update~.

** dap-mode debugger (only for lsp backend)
To use =dap-mode= for debugging do:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  pip install debugpy
#+END_SRC

** Notebook and code cells
To use =code-cells-mode= with ipython notebook automatically you should install
[[https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext][jupytext]]. Make sure that the =ipython-notebook= layer is not used.

Then you can evaluate the current cell in a REPL process with ~SPC m s c~ or all
the cells above with ~SPC m s a~.
You can also move to the next cell with ~SPC m g F~ and to the previous cell
with ~SPC m g B~.

* Configuration
** Fill column
If you want to customize the fill column value, use something like this inside
the =user-init= function in your =.spacemacs=:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
      (python :variables python-fill-column 99)))
#+END_SRC

** Sort imports
If you want imports to be automatically sorted when you save a file (using
[[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/isort][isort]]), set the =python-sort-imports-on-save= variable in the python layer
config section:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    '((python :variables python-sort-imports-on-save t)))
#+END_SRC

or as a directory-local variable (for per-project settings).

** Importmagic
Install importmagic and epc for importmagic functionality.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pip install importmagic epc
#+END_SRC

** Pyvenv, pyenv, pipenv and poetry
Sometimes, it is convenient to be able to use python virtual environments from
other modes. For this reason, the python layer provides the variables
=spacemacs--python-pyenv-modes=, =spacemacs--python-pyvenv-modes=,
=spacemacs--python-poetry-modes= and =spacemacs--python-pipenv-modes=.
If you wish to be able to access these functionalities from other modes,
in your user config section, do:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-to-list 'spacemacs--python-pipenv-modes 'your-mode)
#+END_SRC

This will allow you to use [[https://github.com/pwalsh/pipenv.el][pipenv]] bindings from the mode your-mode.
You can add to the other two lists analogously.

* Management of Python versions and virtual environments
** Manage virtual environments with pyvenv
A virtual environment provides isolation of your Python package versions. For a
general overview see [[http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/][this site]]. [[http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html][Virtualenvwrapper]] which is also explained in the
previous link, is a program which manages your virtual environments in a central
location set by the =WORKON_HOME= environment variable.

Spacemacs integration of virtual environments and virtualenvwrapper is provided
by the [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/pyvenv][pyvenv]] package. It provides the following key bindings:

| Key binding | Description                                     |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC m v a~ | activate a virtual environment in any directory |
| ~SPC m v d~ | deactivate active virtual environment           |
| ~SPC m v w~ | work on virtual environment in =WORKON_HOME=    |

*** Automatic activation of local virtual environment
By default Spacemacs uses the [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/pyvenv][pyvenv]] package to manage virtual environments.
Additionally it uses =pyvenv-tracking-mode= to activate a buffer's local virtual
environment on change of focus. Pyvenv determines which virtual environment to
use from the value of the =pyvenv-workon= or the =pyvenv-activate=
buffer-local-variable. Spacemacs scans the project directory for a pattern
=.venv=. If the found =.venv= is a directory then it sets that directory as the
local virtual environment path. If the =.venv= pattern is a file then it checks if
its first line matches an existing path and if so, it sets it as the local
virtual environment path. Finally it checks if it finds an existing directory
with the name of the first line in the ~pyvenv-workon-home~ directory. By default
Spacemacs scans for a virtual environment and sets the local =pyvenv-workon= or
the =pyvenv-activate= variables on visiting a file, but switches virtual
environment on every change of focus using the local variables. The buffer
tracking behavior can be disabled by setting the value of the customizable
variable =pyvenv-tracking-mode= to =nil=. The scanning behavior can be set via the
variable =python-auto-set-local-pyvenv-virtualenv= to:
- =on-visit= (default) set the virtualenv when you visit a python buffer,
- =on-project-switch= set the virtualenv when you switch projects,
- =nil= to disable.

** Manage multiple Python versions with pyenv
If you need multiple Python versions (e.g. Python 2 and Python 3) then take a
look at [[https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv][pyenv]]. It enables the installation and management of multiple
Python versions.
[[https://www.brianthicks.com/post/2015/04/15/automate-your-python-environment-with-pyenv/][This blogpost]] gives a good overview on how to use the tool. Spacemacs
integration is provided by [[https://github.com/proofit404/pyenv-mode][pyenv mode]] which has the following key bindings.

| Key binding | Description                          |
|-------------+--------------------------------------|
| ~SPC m v s~ | set a pyenv environment with [[https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv][pyenv]]   |
| ~SPC m v u~ | unset a pyenv environment with [[https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv][pyenv]] |

Pyenv can also manage virtual environments for each of the Python versions it
has installed. Those will be listed alongside your Python versions.

*** Automatic activation of local pyenv version
A project-specific pyenv version may be written to a file called
=.python-version= using the [[https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#user-content-pyenv-local][pyenv local]] command.

Spacemacs can search in parent directories for this file, and automatically set
the pyenv version. The behavior can be set with the variable
=python-auto-set-local-pyenv-version= to:
- =on-visit= (default) set the version when you visit a python buffer,
- =on-project-switch= set the version when you switch projects,
- =nil= to disable.

** Manage environments and packages with pipenv
[[https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/][Pipenv]] is the new standard tool to manage your virtual environments. It can act as
a replacement for both =pyenv= and =venv= on a per-repository basis. An overview
of how to use the tool is provided [[https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/basics/][here]].

Spacemacs integration for pipenv is provided by the [[https://github.com/pwalsh/pipenv.el][pipenv package]].
It provides the following key bindings:

| Key binding   | Description                                                |
|---------------+------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC m v p a~ | activate a pipenv environment with [[https://github.com/pwalsh/pipenv.el][pipenv]]                  |
| ~SPC m v p d~ | deactivate a pipenv environment with [[https://github.com/pwalsh/pipenv.el][pipenv]]                |
| ~SPC m v p i~ | install a package into a virtual environment with [[https://github.com/pwalsh/pipenv.el][pipenv]]   |
| ~SPC m v p o~ | open an installed module in a new buffer with [[https://github.com/pwalsh/pipenv.el][pipenv]]       |
| ~SPC m v p s~ | open a shell buffer in the current environment with [[https://github.com/pwalsh/pipenv.el][pipenv]] |
| ~SPC m v p u~ | uninstall a package from a virtual environment with [[https://github.com/pwalsh/pipenv.el][pipenv]] |

** Manage environments and packages with Poetry
Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python.
It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will
manage (install/update) them for you.

Spacemacs integration for Poetry is provided by the [[https://github.com/galaunay/poetry.el][poetry]] package.
It provides the following key bindings:

| Key binding   | Description                                                         |
|---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC m v o d~ | De-activate the virtualenv associated to the current poetry project |
| ~SPC m v o a~ | Activate the virtualenv associated to the current poetry project    |
| ~SPC m v o t~ | Toggle the virtualenv associated to the current poetry project      |

* Key bindings
** Inferior REPL process
Start a Python or iPython inferior REPL process with ~SPC m s i~.
If =ipython= is available in system executable search paths, =ipython=
will be used to launch python shell; otherwise, default =python=
interpreter will be used. You may change your system executable
search path by activating a virtual environment.

Send code to inferior process commands:

| Key binding | Description                                                  |
|-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC m s s~ | send region (or line when region not active) and show output |
| ~SPC m s b~ | send buffer and keep code buffer focused                     |
| ~SPC m s B~ | send buffer and switch to REPL in insert mode                |
| ~SPC m s e~ | send statement and keep code buffer focused                  |
| ~SPC m s E~ | send statement and switch to REPL in insert mode             |
| ~SPC m s f~ | send function and keep code buffer focused                   |

| ~SPC m s R~ | send region and switch to REPL in insert mode                |
| ~CTRL+j~    | next item in REPL history                                    |
| ~CTRL+k~    | previous item in REPL history                                |

** Running Python Script in shell
To run a Python script like you would in the shell press ~SPC m c c~
to start the Python script in comint mode. This is useful when working with
multiple Python files since the REPL does not reload changes made in other
modules.

| Key binding | Description                                                               |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC m c c~ | Execute current file in a comint shell                                    |
| ~SPC m c C~ | Execute current file in a comint shell and switch to it in =insert state= |

*Note:* With the universal argument ~SPC u~ you can enter a new
compilation command.

** Testing
Test commands start with ~m t~. To use the secondary test runner call the
function with a prefix argument, for example ~SPC u SPC m t a~.

| No Debug    | Description                                              |
|-------------+----------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC m t a~ | launch all tests of the project                          |
| ~SPC m t b~ | launch all tests of the current buffer (same as module)  |
| ~SPC m t l~ | launch last tests                                        |
| ~SPC m t m~ | launch all tests of the current module                   |
| ~SPC m t s~ | launch all tests of the current suite (only with =nose=) |
| ~SPC m t t~ | launch the current test (function)                       |

| Debug       | Description                                                            |
|-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC m t A~ | launch all tests of the project in debug mode                          |
| ~SPC m t B~ | launch all tests of the current buffer (module) in debug mode          |
| ~SPC m t M~ | launch all tests of the current module in debug mode                   |
| ~SPC m t S~ | launch all tests of the current suite in debug mode (only with =nose=) |
| ~SPC m t T~ | launch the current test (function) in debug mode                       |

** Refactoring

| Key binding | Description                                     |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC m r f~ | fix a missing import statement with [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/importmagic][importmagic]] |
| ~SPC m r i~ | remove unused imports with [[https://github.com/myint/autoflake][autoflake]]            |
| ~SPC m r I~ | sort imports with [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/isort][isort]]                         |

** Pip package management
In python buffer type ~SPC m P~ to open buffer listing all installed =pip=
packages in the currently activated virtual environment.

*Note:* To open this menu from outside a python buffer type
~SPC SPC pippel-list-packages RET~.

In the package list buffer:

| Key binding | Description                                                 |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~RET~       | follow link (=pippel-menu-visit-homepage=)                  |
| ~d~         | mark for deletion (=pippel-menu-mark-delete=)               |
| ~i~         | prompt user for packages (=pippel-install-package=)         |
| ~m~         | remove mark (=pippel-menu-mark-unmark=)                     |
