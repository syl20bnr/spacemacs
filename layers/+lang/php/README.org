* Description
This layer adds PHP language support to Spacemacs.

** Features:
- Edit PHP files using [[https://github.com/ejmr/php-mode][php-mode]]
- Edit Drupal files
- Complete and jump to define with [[https://github.com/xcwen/ac-php][company-php]]
- Run tests with PHPUnit
- Reformat code with PHP CBF
- Debug your programs with XDebug (via [[https://github.com/ahungry/geben][geben]] or [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/dap-mode][dap-mode]])
- Refactor source files with help of [[https://github.com/emacs-php/phpactor.el][phpactor.el]]
- Support for the [[https://langserver.org/][Language Server Protocol]] (experimental)

The =gtags= layer is recommended to benefit from better =eldoc= and
=helm-gtags=.

* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =php= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

** Backends
For php you have the choice between a set of possible backends with
different setup instructions and different capabilities.

*** LSP

Note that you'll need to use the =lsp= layer to enable these backends.

**** intelephense
This is the recommended LSP server solution. To activate it set the
layer variable =php-backend=:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (php :variables php-backend 'lsp)
#+END_SRC

and install the npm server with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  npm install -g intelephense
#+END_SRC

You can find further information on the project's [[http://intelephense.net/][website]] and [[https://github.com/bmewburn/vscode-intelephense][GitHub page]].

**** php-language-server
This is an alternative LSP server implementation working on PHP basis rather than nodejs.
To activate it set the layer variable =php-backend= like for the intelephense backend and
install the server via [[https://getcomposer.org/][composer]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  composer require felixfbecker/language-server
  composer run-script --working-dir=vendor/felixfbecker/language-server parse-stubs
#+END_SRC

You can find further information on the project's [[https://github.com/felixfbecker/php-language-server][GitHub page]].


**** Debugging
In case of using any of LSP backends You can debug using [[https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol][dap]].

First of all You have to add =dap= to layer list of Your =dotspacemacs/layers= function of a =.spacemacs= config file.

As mentioned in [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/dap-mode#php][dap-mode doc for php]],
dap-mode uses a [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webfreak.debug][VSCode extension]] as a debugging backend
and includes a convenient =dap-php-setup= command to install it into Your emacs.
To embrace it open any PHP file in any PHP project just after restarting emacs with =dap= layer enabled.
Now You can call the extension installation command: =<M-x> dap-php-setup=.

After that You can try to debug something.
For example add a breakpoint to any of Your phpunit tests with =SPC m d b a=.
And start debuging with =SPC m d d d= and selecting a debug template.
Now run the test to ensure everything is working. The command to run the test while debugging could look like this:
=php -d xdebug.idekey=PHPSTORM -d xdebug.remote_autostart=1 -d xdebug.remote_enable=1 -d xdebug.remote_host=127.0.0.1 -d xdebug.remote_port=9000 bin/phpunit ./path/to/Test.php=
The test is now expected to be paused by emacs/dap when it catches code at the breakpoint.

You may wish to propagate some config options for the VSCode extension which is used as a debug server.
For example if You are running Your code in a docker container the project source path may differ between the container (and Xdebug PHP extension consequently) and Emacs.
The VSCode extension provides a config option to map the path. In VSCode it is done by adding an appropriate json config.
For spacemacs it could be done for example by adding a next call to =dotspacemacs/user-config= function of Your =.spacemacs= config:
  (with-eval-after-load 'dap-php
    (dap-register-debug-template "PHP debug with custom path"
      (list :type "php"
            :cwd nil
            :request "launch"
            :name "Php Debug with path"
            :args '("--server=4711")
            :pathMappings (ht ("/docker/src/path" "/emacs/src/path"))
            :sourceMaps t)))

*** ac-php-core
This is a non server solution working entirely from an elisp package.
This requires no installation of external services but also delivers
the least amount of IDE like integrations with spacemacs.

To activate it just don't set the variable =php-backend= in your dotfile.
Remember that additional setup instructions are necessary on a per
project basis which you can find below.

**** Setup
Because of the way that the ac-php-core package works, there are a couple of simple
initialization tasks which must occur to get the completion working as it should.
On any new project make sure to perform the following initialization tasks:
1. Run the following

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     cd /root/of/project
     touch .ac-php-conf.json
   #+END_SRC

2. Inside of spacemacs run:
   = ac-php-remake-tags =

The =.ac-php-conf.json= file is required to enable auto-completion. When you run
=ac-php-remake-tags= and your =.ac-php-conf.json= file is empty the default configuration
will be used and inserted in the file.

If your project contains the following files at the root folder:
1. =.projectile=
2. =vendor/autoload.php=

the necessary configuration file (=.ac-php-conf.json=) will be created automatically
if it does not exist.

**** Refactoring
This backend provides refactoring and class auto-completion capabilities via [[https://github.com/emacs-php/phpactor.el][phpactor.el]].
To ensure that the phpactor package is intact, just run
~M-x phpactor-install-or-update~ and the package itself will make sure that
you're good to go.

**** Debugging
While using ac-php-core debug capabilities are provided via the [[https://github.com/ahungry/geben][geben package]]. Please refer for details
to the project page.
