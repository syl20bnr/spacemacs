* Description
This layer adds PHP language support to Spacemacs.

** Features:
- Edit PHP files using [[https://github.com/ejmr/php-mode][php-mode]]
- Edit Drupal files
- Complete and jump to define with [[https://github.com/xcwen/ac-php][company-php]]
- Run tests with PHPUnit
- Reformat code with PHP CBF

The =gtags= layer is recommended to benefit from better =eldoc= and
=helm-gtags=.

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =php= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

* Key bindings

| Key binding | Description             |
|-------------+-------------------------|
| ~SPC m g g~ | jump to define at point |
| ~C-t~       | jump back               |

* Usage
Because of the way that the ac-php-core package works, there are a couple of simple
initialization tasks which must occur to get the completion working as it should.
On any new project make sure to perform the following initialization tasks:
1. Run the following

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     cd /root/of/project
     touch .ac-php-conf.json
   #+END_SRC

2. Inside of spacemacs run:
   = ac-php-remake-tags =

The =.ac-php-conf.json= file is required to enable auto-completion. When you run
=ac-php-remake-tags= and your =.ac-php-conf.json= file is empty the default configuration
will be used and inserted in the file.

If your project contains the following files at the root folder:
1. =.projectile=
2. =vendor/autoload.php=

the necessary configuration file (=.ac-php-conf.json=) will be created automatically
if it does not exist.
