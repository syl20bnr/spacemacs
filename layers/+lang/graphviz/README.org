* Description
This contains a forked version of [[https://github.com/ppareit/graphviz-dot-mode][graphviz-dot-mode]] that enables a live-reload
type work flow for editing `.dot` files. When live-preview is enabled, saving
the file will automatically trigger a compilation and reload of the image buffer
associated with the file.

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =graphviz= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

* Configuration
If the live preview is not always updating the rendered image properly, you can
try to adjust the value of =graphviz-dot-revert-delay= higher to give the
compiler more time to finish generating the file before reverting the buffer.
