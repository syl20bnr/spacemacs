Master list of known bugs and feature requests

===
FEATURE
Doing a perlnow code creation command while inside a dired buffer
should use that location by default, rather than the fixed default.
===
BUG
  module man pages don't regard '::' as part of a word.
  Something like this improves things:
  (modify-syntax-entry ?: "w" man-mode-syntax-table)
  Further: might like to exclude "-" (so that '->' doesn't get sucked in).
===
BUG
  Doesn't play nice with tramp.el or ange-ftp, not even a perl check.
  if a remote buffer, make/find a local copy of it and run perl -cw on it?
  (Verify this is still a problem.  --  Apr 15, 2010 )

===
BUG
Doesn't work with
  xemacs
  windows
===
BUG

Sometimes, an existing buffer local value for a run command gets zapped
when you would rather it didn't:

E.g. if you do a "C-c / t" as a convienient way to get back to a *.t file,
the run-string for the *.t file can get changed on you.

Possibly: if a run-string has been set manually, it should be less
emphemeral than if it's an automatic guess.

Sometimes perlnow's attempts at magically setting the run string correctly
get in the way: When you've set it to something else manually, it should
remember that, and avoid over-writing a manual setting.   An "attribute"
to the string, to tell it hands-off?

===
BUG                  Tue Dec 29 15:10:54 2009

C-c / R
  let's you set the run-string, but it  always (often?)
  zeroes it out to the original guess value: this makes
  it hard to do repeated edits of the run-string.

===
BUG

If the *compilation* buffer is already displayed in some other frame,
that can cause problems.  Possible fix: always kill *compilation*
before a perlnow-run.  (verify still a problem -- Thu Apr 15 12:46:59 2010)

===
FEATURE
Built-in support for perltidy (alternative to C-M-\)
  Experimental (Sun May 30 10:06:20 2010):
  perlnow-run-perltidy-on-region

  o maybe: automatically generate standard elisp wrappers
    around some frequently used shell commands.
    (begun compiling a "cookbook" of types of wrappers)

  In particular, could use some good ways to run "at point"
  without defining a region.


===
FEATURE
sub awareness
  o narrow to current sub (Q: include adjacent pod?)
      like narrow-to-defun
  o select sub (Q: include adjacent pod?)
  o move sub (both code and pod, if any, adjacent or not).
       i.e. "refactoring" tools.
  o display current sub in status bar.

                                     Thu Apr 15 12:49:52 2010
  Maybe: come up with a style of two-window display for subs.
  When working on a sub, you see the code in one, and the
  documentation in the other, irrespective of whether it's
  actually adjacent to the code, or buried down at the bottom.

===
Want to run ispell on pod only.
Alternately: run ispell on pod and comments only.
(How?)

   perlnow-ispell-next-chunk-of-pod

Then interate over all of them with:

   perlnow-ispell-pod

Also useful:

   perlnow-ispell-this-chunk-of-pod

===

Beyond etags: better indexing of perl code.  Swish-E?  A distro feature?
Maybe use B:* modules to report on all subs: definitions *and* where called
   B::Xref - Generates cross reference reports for Perl programs
Note: look into glimpse and "glimpse-mode" (Tom Lane likes glimpse).

                                       Thu Apr 15 12:52:29 2010
(1) perlnow-ack is an excellent stop-gap for this kind of thing.
(2) need to review what other people have got (sepia, etc).

===

Support for other templating systems (template-i.el, "template independant")
   tempo.el
   Template::Toolkit
   Mason

Possibly: a translator to create tempo.el files from template.el templates.

Another "policy" feature: default types of template for
(1) file creation
(2) insertion of method framework (skeleton?)

===
C-M-f and C-M-b, when used in the middle of an expression, should skip
you to the beginning or end of that expression (currently, it just
errors).
===
run-string
  o  need additional ones, e.g. a 'debug' as well as a 'run' and 'test'?
  o  manipulation commands, e.g. perlnow-save-run-string-to-alt-run-string
===
Select an active set of templates based on various settings.
For example, need to support various OOP styles:
  o Inside-Out,  (Class::Std, Class::InsideOut, Object::InsideOut)
  o Moose
  o Simple href-based (with seperation of new and _init) ala Class::Base
===
Support different podstyles
  o  additional templates for interspersed pod style
  o  defcustom to define a preference?
  o  skeleton.el: for subs/methods/constructors/accessors...
===

Better help command:

Currently the "C-c / 1" command just looks up built-ins in "perlfunc".

Could be extended to look up the perldoc for a sub, so that
it works on built-ins *and* extensions.
===

Investigate supporting use of "use diagnostics;", e.g. use a C-u
prefix to "C-c / c" to add a -Mdiagnostics to the run line.

===

Settable option:
  (defcustom perlnow-maximum-sleaziness t)

  (The fourth virtue: sleaziness.)

  Identify all variables used, and create "my" declarations
  for them if needed.
  If usage is inside a sub, put the my also inside that sub.
  Note: if globals are in use, this can break.

===
                                    Sat May 29, 2004  7:43 PM
shift-R (and A) let's you change the run-string:
implement shift-C and shift-D (change check command
and debug command).

===
How about Mason code?   Any special template.el templates
for that?  Any peculiarities with "multimode"?

===

I often create run-strings that can't be handed to the
debugger, e.g.

   'cd ~/dev/h2xs-stuff/Hack-To-Excess-Module/; make test'

It would be better if you could *always* switch to running
with "C-c'd" without worrying about changing the run-string
manually.

Approaches:
(1) Avoid prefix commands: "cd blah;"  Instead, set
default-directory before doing the compile.  Possibly,
the run-string should have some "properties" assigned to it,
one of which would be the location that the command expects
to be run.

(2) Make perlnow-perldb smarter.  Have it examine the
run-string and do something a little different if it seems
adviseable, e.g. pick out "cd blah;" and translate it into
a default-directory change, possibly translate "make test"
into something the debugger can use

(3) add yet another buffer-local run-string, one solely for
debugger use.  (least painful, no? -- Thu Apr 15 13:00:02 2010)

===

The script-using-this-module command could get
"$self->current_method_name" pushed into the kill-ring,
instead of just "current_sub_name".

===

Write code that goes backwards from
   testfile + policy => code under test
on general principle that it'll be useful someday:

The test file name, and the test policy could be
intepreted backwards to determine what's being tested.

===
                                       Thu Feb 26 11:59:19 2004

When a script run-string ends in a re-direct "> blah.txt",
perlnow should assume that the user will want to see that
file.  It should be opened in a freshly "reverted" buffer
at the bottom of the screen (or something).

===

Diagramming of perl classes?  Of dependencies?

===
                                            Thu Feb 26 11:59:24 2004
Need to think carefully about what buffers should be
displayed when... avoid messing with the buffer layout if
possible (closing all competing windows just to make sure
you've got room to open another is excessively fascist).

                                           Fri Apr 23 20:27:03 2004
Created centralized file open and buffer display
routines, to simplify fixing this later

    perlnow-open-file-other-window
    perlnow-show-buffer-other-window

====

                                      Mon Apr 19 11:29:51 2004
Break out behavior of run-string(s) history into configurable settings:
  o  joint history vs separate history.
  o  buffer-local vs global history.
  o  number of concurrently defined runstring commands.
===

Test with xemacs.  Easy enough.

===

Integration with bug database(s)... somehow?

===

 perlnow-script-using-this-module
 Option to include the SYNOPSIS section, in commented out form

===

Possible feature:

;;; Weird feature idea: when just tabbing away, and you get to
;;; a level boundary, current behavior is to add a separator "/".
;;; Does not switch to "::" until the user has entered one.
;;; Might be better to consult the @INC array, and guess that it's
;;; time to switch to :: once you've entered a module-root.
;;; Sounds cool, but, like: MUCH later.

===

Another thought: generate-test-to-lock-behavior.

I often want to do things backwards: develop a script
that generates some output, then decide that it's working.
Then I want to automatically generate a test script that
will lock the current behavior, so I can continue modifying
the script, and verify that it still does what it did before
when I decided it was working.

If script has a run-string of the form
  perl script input-file > output-file
This is *relatively* easy... Makes copy of the input-file,
saves a copy of the output, uses a simple test to make
sure that in the future the one file is generated by the other.

===

perl-later.el or perl-refactory.el

Maybe: think about the various *actually* workflows that
people *really* use.  Like, you write a script, then
realize you want to move parts of it into a module.
("refactoring")

How about a perlnow-move-this-sub-to-library as an alternate
to cut-and-paste?  A new library *or* an already existing
library.  Make it EXPORT_OK, add in a "use" line that brings
it in.

===

Maybe:
  perlnow-use-this-module-to-other-window

Theory is you've got a module window open, and are browsing
code or docs for some other module in the other window.
You decide, yeah, I want to use this too.  Command should
check if the additional module is in INC, if not do the
appropriate use lib, and so on.

===

Add mouse menu stuff?
Hard for me to get right, since I don't use any of it.

===

Create hooks.  (*after* and *before*, right?)
perlnow-new-script-hook,
perlnow-new-module-hook,
perlnow-h2xs--hook

===

Can you fix "man" with a wrapper?  Goal is to *never* lose
your original context.  When you follow a link, the content
replaces current man window, web browser style.

===
                           Fri Mar  3, 2006  1:43 PM

Just thinking... if the pod for a sub is somewhere some distance
away from the sub, it would be usefult to have commands to jump
from one to the other...
Maybe to display the other in another window.

E.g., while editing a sub, you say
perlnow-sub-perldoc-other-window,
and it shows you the corresponding =item
(or... if one doesn't exist, it guesses where
to put it based on proximity to other subs).

And vice-versa, starting with perldoc, and then writing a sub.

===

The listing of subs in the current file would be a useful
feature.   Make it a hot list, so you can "click" on one
and jump to it.  (Or jump to it's pod?)  Would also
like to able to do an insert, start writing a new sub
given the list of subs...

(( starting to sound like some other ide-ish packages ))


===

                                Sat Mar  4 20:47:29 2006

The edit-test file thing is doing something funny with the
window sizes...  If you don't have a lot of screen lines,
you can get a "window not large enough to subdivide" error,
which seems pretty weird when you've only got one window
open.  The balance between the window sizes can seem
weird, too... (Probably an intended feature, to make the
new window a little larger than the old.)

===

Improve C-c / b navigation.  See: /home/doom/End/Cave/Perlnow/Notes/notes-perlnow-version-0.4

===

Lexical search: automatically narrows to current lexical scope.
Or failing that, just the current sub (easier).

===

Need a template for a *.conf file.
Maybe: a *.sql file.

===

Need to cover all the perl file extensions:
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.\\([pP][Llm]\\|al\\|t\\|pod\\)\\'" . cperl-mode)) ; .pm .pl .t .pod .al?
Q: what's *.al?
Q: what about *.mas?  Check mmm-mode set-up.

===

I'd like a feature like this... but it's dependant on certain
assumptions about how you like to do OOP.

perlnow-document-accessors-from-attributes-array

presuming you have an @attributes = qw( ); list in a sub init
(or sub _init or sub new), skip down to just after the closing

1;

and insert some simple pod boilerplate listing the accessors.

Note: needs to know what naming convention you're using (embedded inside
AUTOLOAD?).

First cut: just hard code that.

approach: find sub name, do a narrow-to-defun, search for '@attributes',
if fails, try another sub candidate.

List can be written in a few ways... presume qw and whitespace sep as
a first cut.

Try searching for m{ 1; .*? \A\z\A=  }msx  (translated into elisp).

===

A need for shared blocks of text between templates
that are also project-specific: e.g. the copyright
notice.  Define these as defvar strings, make them
available to template.el templates as tokens.

===

                         Fri Mar  7 02:38:46 2008
perlnow-perlversion-old-to-new:
Get a definitive list of cases of perl versions that it
should handle, write a unit test, and refactor this.
The regexps here probably need improvement.

(And the state of policy surrounding perl versions
are continually in flux.)

===

*Really* need to replace blank lines with empty lines on
either side of a pod tag (^=).

For that matter, opening up empty lines on either side of
pod tags would probably be a good idea.

===

If you create a module from another module, should you get the
same automatic use features that scripts get?

===

Creating a script in a cpan-style tree, the script should
default to being inside the tree, in the right place, maybe:
  <staging area>/bin

===

                                   Thu Dec 10 17:21:43 2009
  What if you want to create a test file first?
  If you start from a text file, and do a: C-c / t
  You get:

    perlnow-search-through-test-path called.
    setq: Args out of range: "notes-nxhtml", 13, 12

===

BUG               Wed Dec 30 17:26:50 2009

C-c / a

Symbol's function definition is void:
 perlnow-guess-script-run-string

===

BUG

You can run C / s and feed it what is obviously a module name.
It creates a script with double-colons embedded in the name.

===

BUG

From a module:
C-c / R

Appears to create a *.t file, before
prompting for a run-string,

And the prompted run-string defaults to running the *.pm file,
not the *.t.

===


BUG               Thu Jan  7 23:06:26 2010

Down in here:
         ~/End/Cave/TextCap/Wall/Cpan/Text-Capitalize/t/lib/Test/Locale/Utils.pm
Doing a  C-c / R

Messages:

perlnow-list-test-files, looking at buffer: Utils.pm

setq: Opening directory: no such file or directory, /home/doom/End/Cave/TextCap/Wall/Cpan/Text-Capitalize/t/t/

What I want to do is *set* the run-string.

default, but it's not failing gracefully.

===
                     Fri Feb 26 19:42:32 2010
BUG
Creating a test file in a non-cpan location
doesn't respect the numbered *.t file convention
(or doesn't seem to).

If there's a 00-*.t file there already, it doesn't
take that as a hint.

(( But then... what if one "t" directory is used
   for test files for multiple modules? ))

===

                       Fri Feb 26 19:40:29 2010
BUGLET

This only works from inside of the *.t file:
   perlnow-revise-test-plan
It should also work from the *compiliation* window,
(or for that matter, from an associated *.pm, no?)

===

FEATURE

If you rename a file, there should be a way to make
sure that the "associated buffer" is also renamed, in
sync.  How?

Modify dired, to watch out for the case?

Overide the rename command with one that special cases my cases...

===
                       Wed Apr  7 15:24:51 2010

BUGLET

Creating a script from a "*WoMan" buffer for a module,
doesn't give you the "use" line for the module.

===

BUG

Would have liked perlnow to find this already existing "t",
and create this file:

  ~/End/Ag/API/Goncarova/gen/t/Goncarova-Image-Mod.t

When it was started up from this file:

  ~/End/Ag/API/Goncarova/gen/lib/perl/Goncarova/Image/Mod.pm

Instead it put it in

  ~/End/Ag/API/Goncarova/gen/lib/perl/Goncarova/Image/t

===

BUGLET

Create a file in a wrong place (say a *.t)
This sets the run-string.
You move the file (using dired) to where you want it,
emacs realizes that the buffer should point at the
new location... but the run-string stays un-revised.

If it stalled on guessing a run-string until it was actually
run, this little problem would be covered.

===

                                Thu Apr 15 12:42:53 2010

Really need some form of automated tests.
I've had a lot of difficulty in getting consistent behavior
with the most recent versions (circa 0.4).  E.g. improve
the code to guess a run-string, and realize belatedly that
you're blowing away user-set run-strings at odd times.

===

                                Thu Apr 15 14:17:15 2010

Look at declared variables in a given scope (a sub?)
and report on any that are un-used.  Possibly: mark them
up with comments, which can then be used to remove them.

That could work with something like an "unpack object"
routine that generates a chunk of code like
  my $atttribute = $self->attribute;
  my $widgit     = $self->widgit;
  my $flag       = $self->flag;

unpack all object attributes (alt form: hash fields),
then later clean-up the un-used ones.

BUG
perlnow-revise-export-list

When trying to publish sub names to an export list ending in
exported hash variables, have seen it add a list of sub names
with '%' marks in front of them (as though they, too, were
hashes).  (?)

FEATURE

Perlnow has creation commands that distinguish between proceedural
(exported-based) modules, and object-based modules: that works well,
for me.  Depending on what I'm doing, I might want to do either...

Obviously though, there are *many* ways of doing object-based perl
modules.  Does it make sense to have only one set of templates for that?

My theory has been that the way to do it is to swap in different sets
of templates on a project-by-project basis, which hopefully can be
done without perlnow knowing anything about it.

But I *personally* would probably like to have multiple styles available
*without* switching projects (facilitate experimentation).  (For me,
a "project" might be evaluating styles).

But multiplying the number of creation commands doesn't sound like
a great way to deal with that... *possibly* one could have a default
style, and alternate styles accessed via the prefix command C-u.
Like, if string, use it as an object style-name, if numeric, bring
up a menu of such styles... something like that.  Maybe, if prefix,
ask for a style name, using the usual auto-completion features.

   Maybe just: "style" setting separate from "project" setting.

Similar idea, no?: "plug-ins" choosen by "style" (or "world"?).
Note: many projects may belong to one world.

   Come to grips with the Too Many Ways To Do It problem.
   You just *can't* support all of them.

    In addition to the general perlnow.el package, add variants
    that deal with different perl sub-worlds: perlnow-moose.el
    perlnow-class-base.el, etc.

    In effect "plug-ins".

                                          Sat May 29 13:32:20 2010

perlnow has a few "creation" commands, but it lacks one to
"create" test files.  The "perlnow-edit-test-file" does creation
only when it can't find anything pre-existing (and most of the
time, that's the Wrong Thing, it just didn't succeed in looking
in the right place).  The multiple forms of "edit-test" are cool,
but I *also* need one that definitely creates a new file
(though in fact, mutating from an existing file is a pretty common
idiom, isn't it... is that automatable in any way?  e.g. scrape
the "use" lines, snag other stuff that looks like set-up, and
re-use it).

===

PERLNOW FEATURE:
  standardized way of overriding other templates...
  run mod star, then replace any of the generated files
  with your own, if you've defined/created a replacement

  ~/End/Cave/Lightning/Notes/notes-writing_cpan_modules:

      I'm really disliking the standard *.t files that
      come out of Module::Starter.

      From the -T flag in the hashbang, to the lack of a
      use lib line, they're good for nothing but running
      in one single way, and I like to run my *.t files
      other ways.

TODO CAVING (?)

When creating a new room, also create git repo?

I'm always going to want one of these:
  ~/End/Cave/Rep/Wall/Emacs-Rep/.gitignore

.gitignore:
*~
\#*#

Question: is my old "lib" and "bin" obsolete now?
Is there a better way to distinguish public and private
than the "Wall"?

"publication" of code gets different if you're planning on using
github...

===

Sat Jun  5 00:27:09 2010

I think the *right* way to deal with version numbers is that
there should be a project-wide version number, and every file
should have the same version number hard-coded in it.

Might like a command (a function fired by save-hook?) like so:
  perlnow-update-version-numbers

This would look at the Build.PL to find out which version is king.

===

BUG NOMENCLATURE                 Sun Jun 13 14:10:28 2010

I treat these as synonyms:

   MODULE NAME or PACKAGE NAME: perl's double colon separated
   name, e.g. \"Modular::Stuff\"

These days, I'm inclined to reserve "package name" for something
like a CPAN tarball.

===
