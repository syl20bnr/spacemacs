Bug fixes with script creation from different contexts (e.g. man page,
woman page, etc).  Pushing out as version 0.43.

Added a user feature to display the current default @INC in an emacs buffer:

   perlnow-display-inc-array

Examining @INC in a readable format is something I often want, so why not?

 o  Added features that use module-starter to create Module::Build
    based projects.

 o  Defined additional template expansions:

    (>>>FULL_DATE<<<)        August 23, 2009
    (>>>AMERICAN_DATE<<<)    8/23/09

 o  Re-wrote perlnow-get-inc-spot-classic: fixes the generation of relative
    paths between a script and a module it uses.

Smaller changes:

 o  perlnow-check now turns on strict as well as warnings during the
    check phase.

 o  Added feature to silently ignore redundant ".pm" extensions fed
    to perlnow-module. Entering "/tmp/dev/Module::Stuff.pm" to
    longer creates "/tmp/dev/Module/Stuff.pm.pm".

 o  Fixed bug with perlnow-h2xs, which would crash when trying to
    find a string in the generated test file which no longer exists:
    now just moves point to bottom of test file.

The function perlnow-define-standard-keymappings now allows
you to override the "C-c/" prefix with a different choice, for
example:

  (perlnow-define-standard-keymappings "\C-'")

Modified perlnow-perlversion-old-to-new to pass
through newer style versions such as "5.8.0" unchanged.

Removed dependancy of perlnow-edit-test-file on the marker
(>>>9<<<) in the test file template: now it searches for the "use"
(or "use_ok") line for the module, via the new perlnow-jump-to-use
function.
