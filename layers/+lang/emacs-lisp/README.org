* Description
This layer gathers all the configuration related to emacs-lisp. This should
always be in your dotfile, it is not recommended to uninstall it.

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =emacs-lisp= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

* Auto-compile
This layer adds the [[https://github.com/tarsius/auto-compile][auto-compile]] package to automatically keep the byte-compiled
version of your Emacs lisp files synced with the uncompiled version on every
save. If there are any compiler errors in the file, you will see a counter show
up in the mode line. You can hover over these numbers to get a description or
view the compiler output with the ~SPC m c l~ key binding. To disable the
feature use this line in your =dotspacemacs/user-config= function.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (remove-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'auto-compile-mode)
#+END_SRC

You can also exclude the =auto-compile= package.

* Working with lisp files (barfage, slurpage & more)
Spacemacs comes with a special ~lisp-state~ for working with lisp code that
supports slurpage, barfage and more tools you'll likely want when working with
lisp.

As this state works the same for all files, the documentation is in global
[[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/doc/DOCUMENTATION.org#lisp-key-bindings][DOCUMENTATION.org]]. In general, use ~SPC k~ to interact with the lisp-state.

* Key bindings

| Key Binding                | Description                            |
|----------------------------+----------------------------------------|
| ~SPC m g g~                | go to definition of symbol under point |
| ~SPC m h h~                | describe symbol at point               |
| ~SPC m c c~                | byte compile the current file          |
| ~SPC m c l~                | popup compile-log buffer               |
| ~SPC m e $~ or ~SPC m e l~ | go to end of current line and evaluate |
| ~SPC m e b~                | evaluate current buffer                |
| ~SPC m e C~                | evaluate current =defun= or =setq=     |
| ~SPC m e e~                | evaluate sexp before point             |
| ~SPC m e f~                | evaluation current function            |
| ~SPC m e r~                | evaluate current region                |
| ~SPC m ​,​~                  | toggle =lisp state=                    |
| ~SPC m t b~                | run tests of current buffer            |
| ~SPC m t q~                | run =ert=                              |
| ~SPC m d m~                | open [[https://github.com/joddie/macrostep][macrostep]] transient-state         |

** Additional evualation functions
If =smartparens= is used the following additional key bindings are available:

| Key Binding | Description                  |
|-------------+------------------------------|
| ~SPC m e c~ | evaluate sexp around point   |
| ~SPC m e s~ | evaluate symbol around point |

** Format code
The [[file:../../semantic/README.org][semantic]] layer should be installed for these key bindings to become active.

| Key Binding | Description             |
|-------------+-------------------------|
| ~SPC m = b~ | format current buffer   |
| ~SPC m = f~ | format current function |
| ~SPC m = o~ | format all on one line  |
| ~SPC m = s~ | format current sexp     |

** Debugging

| Key Binding | Description                                                            |
|-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC m d f~ | on a =defun= symbol toggle on the instrumentalisation of the function  |
| ~SPC m d F~ | on a =defun= symbol toggle off the instrumentalisation of the function |
| ~SPC m d t~ | insert =(debug)= to print the stack trace and re-evaluate the function |
