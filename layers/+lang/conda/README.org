#+TITLE: Conda Layer

#+TAGS: layer|programming|util

* Description
This layer integrates [[https://github.com/necaris/conda.el][conda.el]] with Spacemacs's UI, placing shortcuts to its
functions under =SPC a= (applications). =conda.el= allows users to interact with
Anaconda and Miniconda environments from Emacs -- this is not the same
as =anaconda-mode=, which provides IDE-like features for Python.

* Install
To add this layer to Spacemacs, add =conda= to your
=dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list, then set the variable =conda-anaconda-home= to
the path to your installation of anaconda.
