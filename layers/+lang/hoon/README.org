* Description
This layer adds support for the Hoon language used by Urbit. See the [[http://urbit.org/docs/hoon/][hoon documentation]] for further information on the language.

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =hoon= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

* Key bindings
At the moment there are no key bindings. They will be added when the upstream code supports some.
