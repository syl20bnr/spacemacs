* Description
BibTeX and BibLaTeX files are a common way to manage bibliographies. The format
was original designed to work with LaTeX files and subsequently has been adopted
by other markup formats such as MarkDown and Org mode.

This layer adds support to manipulate BibTeX and BibLaTeX files in Spacemacs.

** Features:
- Syntax highlighting for BibTeX and BibLaTeX files.
- Utilities for automatically adding entries from different data sources.
- Support for inserting citations in various other modes.
- Optionally install full fledged [[https://joostkremers.github.io/ebib/ebib-manual.html][ebib reference manager]]

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =bibtex= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

* Configuration
This layer also supports having a global BibTeX file. For a basic
configuration, add this to your =~/.spacemacs= inside
=dotspacemacs/user-config=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-ref-default-bibliography '("~/Papers/references.bib")
        org-ref-pdf-directory "~/Papers/"
        org-ref-bibliography-notes "~/Papers/notes.org")
#+END_SRC

Certain modes, such as =latex-mode= with AucTeX, will automatically lookup
references in a document if any of the recognized bibliography commands are
used. Other modes may have a similar feature, or one could always set
file-local variables (through ~SPC f v f~).

You can also customize which program is used to display the PDFs. For example,
to use Zathura:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-ref-open-pdf-function
    (lambda (fpath)
      (start-process "zathura" "*helm-bibtex-zathura*" "/usr/bin/zathura" fpath)))
#+END_SRC

More configuration options are available and are detailed in the =org-ref=,
=helm-bibtex=, =ivy-bibtex= and [[https://github.com/cpitclaudel/biblio.el][biblio]] package documentations.

** Ebib and biblio
To enable installation of the [[https://joostkremers.github.io/ebib/ebib-manual.html][ebib reference manager]] set the variable
=bibtex-enable-ebib-support= as shown in the following code block:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (bibtex :variables
          bibtex-enable-ebib-support t
          ebib-preload-bib-files '("path-to-bib-file.bib")
          ebib-file-search-dirs '("/path-to-documents-directory")
          ebib-import-directory "path-to-e.g.-download-directory")
#+END_SRC

The code block also shows how to set some optional [[https://joostkremers.github.io/ebib/ebib-manual.html][ebib]] variables.

With the installation of the =ebib= package, Spacemacs automatically loads the
[[https://joostkremers.github.io/ebib/ebib-manual.html#integration-with-the-biblio-package][ebib-biblio]] package that uses the [[https://github.com/cpitclaudel/biblio.el][biblio]] package to provide an easy way of
fetching citations from the web into the database (follow the links to the
packages additional descriptions and usage instructions).

* Key bindings
In a Bib(La)TeX file, the following key bindings are added:

| Key binding               | Description                                |
