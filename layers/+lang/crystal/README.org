* Description
This layer provides support for the Crystal language.

** Features:
- =crystal tool format= on file save
- integration [[https://play.crystal-lang.org][play.crystal-lang.org]] using [[https://github.com/veelenga/play-crystal.el][play-crystal.el]]
- Linting with flycheck
- test runner (=crystal spec=)
- =crystal tool= integration
- Interactive REPL ([[https://github.com/brantou/inf-crystal.el][inf-crystal.el]] and [[https://github.com/crystal-community/icr][icr]])
- static code analysis using [[https://github.com/veelenga/ameba.el][ameba]]

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =crystal= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

** REPL
To be able to connect to [[https://github.com/brantou/inf-crystal.el][inf-crystal]], you need to make sure that [[https://github.com/crystal-community/icr][icr]] is
