* Description
This simple layer adds support for the [[http://dlang.org/][D language]].
It adds =d-mode= as well as integrating it with =auto-completion= and =syntax-checking=.

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =d= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

To enable smart D completion, you need to install [[https://github.com/Hackerpilot/DCD][DCD]]. Here are [[https://github.com/Hackerpilot/DCD#setup][installation
instructions]]. After successfully built DCD, you need to copy the binary
=dcd-server= and  =dcd-client= in =bin/= directory to somewhere in your $PATH e.g.
=/usr/local/bin= on Linux.
