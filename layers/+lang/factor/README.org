* Description
A spacemacs layer for Factor language support.

** Features:
- Syntax Highlighting
- Factor REPL integration
- Auto-Completion in REPL
- Scaffolding support
- Refactoring support

* Install
This layer depends on the elisp files that are bundled with factor. To use this
layer, make sure that factor is installed and the bundled elisp files are picked
up by emacs (usually somewhere in site-lisp).

To use this layer, add it to your =./spacemacs= file. Add =factor= to the
=dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list there.

* Snippets
This layer provides a yasnippet for colon definitions, which can be expanded
after typing a single ~:~. Note that you might have
to set =yas-triggers-in-field= to nil if you use =x= for stack effect
declaration elements a lot, as this will trigger a builtin snippet from
prog-mode instead of advancing to the next field when pressing =<TAB>=.
