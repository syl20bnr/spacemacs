* Description
This simple layer adds support for shell scripting.

Supported scripting files:
- =.sh=
- =.fish=: [[https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell][fish shell]]

*Note:* For Windows scripting see the layer =windows-scripts=

** Features:
- Auto-completion using [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/company-shell][company-shell]]
- =Sh= scripts linting using [[https://www.shellcheck.net/][shellcheck]]
- =Sh= scripts style checking using [[https://github.com/openstack-dev/bashate][bashate]]
- Support for the [[https://langserver.org/][Language Server Protocol]] (experimental)
- Automatic formatting via [[https://github.com/mvdan/sh][shfmt]]

* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =shell-scripts= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

** Linting
In order to enable =sh= scripts linting, install [[https://www.shellcheck.net/][shellcheck]].

** Style checking
In order to enable =sh= scripts style checking, install [[https://github.com/openstack-dev/bashate][bashate]].

** Format
To support formatting of buffers you need to install the application
shfmt. This can be done like shown below

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  go install mvdan.cc/sh/v3/cmd/shfmt@latest
#+END_SRC

** Format on save
To enable automatic formatting on save, set the layer variable
~shell-scripts-format-on-save~ to ~t~:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (shell-scripts :variables shell-scripts-format-on-save t)
#+END_SRC

** Backends
You have the choice between two different backends
with different setup instructions and different capabilities.

The LSP backend is automatically selected when the =lsp= layer is used
and is the recommended one.

*** LSP
This backend uses an external server to provide the various IDE integrations
and a more modern UI integration in =spacemacs=.

However it only supports working with =bash= scripts.

It requires installing the external server via:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  npm i -g bash-language-server
#+END_SRC

You can find further information about the project at its [[https://github.com/mads-hartmann/bash-language-server][GitHub page]].

Set the variable =shell-scripts-backend= to select the LSP backend explicitly.
This will result in the =lsp= layer being loaded.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (shell-scripts :variables shell-scripts-backend 'lsp)
#+END_SRC

*** Shell-script-mode
This is the more basic alternative for working with shell scripts in emacs. It works
by using an emacs major mode and is slower and less complete than the LSP alternative.

It supports =bash= and =fish= shell scripts.

Set =shell-scripts-backend= to =nil= explicitly to use this simple backend.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (shell-scripts :variables shell-scripts-backend nil)
#+END_SRC
