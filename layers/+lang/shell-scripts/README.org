* Description
This simple layer adds support for shell scripting.

Supported scripting files:
- =.sh=
- =.fish=: [[https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell][fish shell]]

*Note:* For Windows scripting see the layer =windows-scripts=

** Features:
- Auto-completion using [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/company-shell][company-shell]]
- =Sh= scripts linting using [[https://www.shellcheck.net/][shellcheck]]
- =Sh= scripts style checking using [[https://github.com/openstack-dev/bashate][bashate]]
- Support for the [[https://langserver.org/][Language Server Protocol]] (experimental)

* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =shell-scripts= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

** Linting
In order to enable =sh= scripts linting, install [[https://www.shellcheck.net/][shellcheck]].

** Style checking
In order to enable =sh= scripts style checking, install [[https://github.com/openstack-dev/bashate][bashate]].

** Backends
You have the choice between two different backends
with different setup instructions and different capabilities.

*** Shell-script-mode
This is the recommended way for working with shell scripts in emacs. It works
by using an emacs major mode.

It supports =bash= and =fish= shell scripts.

No additional setup is necessary.

*** LSP
This backend uses an external server to provide the various IDE integrations
and a more modern UI integration in =spacemacs=.

However it only supports working with =bash= scripts.

It requires installing the external server via:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  npm i -g bash-language-server
#+END_SRC

Enable the =lsp= layer to activate this backend as well as setting the layer
variable =shell-scripts-backend=:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (shell-scripts :variables shell-scripts-backend 'lsp)
#+END_SRC

You can find further information about the project at its [[https://github.com/mads-hartmann/bash-language-server][GitHub page]].
