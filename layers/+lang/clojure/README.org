- Aligning of code forms via [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode][clojure-mode]]
- Debugging with [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/sayid][sayid]]
- Clojure cheatsheet
- Structuraly safe editing using optional [[https://github.com/luxbock/evil-cleverparens][evil-cleverparens]]
- Linting via [[https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo][clj-kondo]] ([[https://github.com/candid82/joker][joker]] and [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/squiggly-clojure][squiggly-clojure]] also available)

*** Related layers
The following Spacemacs layers should also be added for a complete experience.
- auto-completion
- syntax-checking (provides flycheck for linter support)

*** Other optional features
- Refactoring via [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el][clj-refactor]]
- Debugging with [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/sayid][sayid]] (beta)

*** References

* Install
Spacemacs will prompt to install the Clojure layer automatically when opening a file ending in =.clj=
=.cljs=, =.cljc= or =.edn=. Replying ~y~ will download all the packages for the Clojure layer.
Restarting Spacemacs, ~SPC q r~, is recommended to ensure all changes are loaded.

** Add the Clojure Layer manually
Edit the =~/.spacemacs= file and add the word =clojure= to the existing
=dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list.

** Pretty Symbols
Pretty symbols for anonymous functions, set literals and partial, like =(λ [a]
(+ a 5))=, =ƒ(+ % 5)=, =∈{2 4 6}= and =Ƥ=.

To enable this feature, add the following snippet to the
=dotspacemacs/user-config= section of your =~/.spacemacs= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq clojure-enable-fancify-symbols t)
#+END_SRC

Or set this variable when loading the configuration layer:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
  '((clojure :variables clojure-enable-fancify-symbols t)))
#+END_SRC

** Enabling Automatic Linting
[[https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo][clj-kondo]], [[https://github.com/candid82/joker][joker]] and [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/squiggly-clojure][squiggly-clojure]] provide automated linting via =flycheck=.
These packages are disabled by default as they require the relevant linter binaries
to be installed locally.

The recommended linter is to use [[https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo][clj-kondo]] in combination with [[https://github.com/candid82/joker][joker]]. Together they catch the most issues while both running extremely quickly.

squiggly reloads your code on every change which gives unexpected results if
your code is not re-loadable. squiggly also requires =org.clojure/core.typed= be
added to the development dependencies of your projects or build tool when using
=cider-connect=.

*** Enable clj-kondo linter
This linter based on static syntax checking and requires the [[https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo][clj-kondo]] binary
installed on the system PATH that =spacemacs.env= includes. Please read the
[[https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/install.md][clj-kondo binary installation instructions]]

Enable the clj-kondo automatic linter in Spacemacs by adding a =:variables= option
to your Spacemacs configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Witout any variables your configuration would just include clojure
  dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
  '(...
    clojure
    )

  ;; to use clj-kondo as a linter, add this variable to the clojure layer
  ;; wrapping the clojure layer in a list
  dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
  '(...
    (clojure :variables
             clojure-enable-linters 'clj-kondo)
    )
#+END_SRC

*** Enable joker linter
This linter is based on static syntax checking and requires the [[https://github.com/candid82/joker][joker]] binary
installed on the system PATH that =spacemacs.env= includes. Please read the
[[https://github.com/candid82/joker#installation][joker binary installation instructions]]

Enable the joker automatic linter in Spacemacs by adding a =:variables= option
to your Spacemacs configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Witout any variables your configuration would just include clojure
  dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
  '(...
    clojure
    )

  ;; to use joker as a linter, add this variable to the clojure layer
  ;; wrapping the clojure layer in a list
  dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
  '(...
    (clojure :variables
             clojure-enable-linters 'joker)
    )
#+END_SRC

*** Enable Squiggly linter
[[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/squiggly-clojure][squiggly-clojure]] uses [[https://github.com/jonase/eastwood][Eastwood]] and [[https://github.com/jonase/kibit][Kibit]] for linting. Please install these projects
before configuring Spacemacs with =squiggly=.

Make sure to read the [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/squiggly-clojure#warnings][squiggly-clojure warnings section]].

Please read the section on [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/squiggly-clojure#dependencies-in-clojure][squiggly dependencies]] if you are using =cider-connect=

Enable the squiggly (eastwood, kibit and core.typed) automatic linter in Spacemacs by adding a =:variables= option to your Spacemacs configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Without any variables your configuration would just include Clojure
  dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
  '(...
    clojure
    )

  ;; to use squiggly as a linter, add this variable to the clojure layer
  ;; wrapping the clojure layer in a list
  dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    '(...
      (clojure :variables
               clojure-enable-linters 'squiggly)
      )

#+END_SRC

Troubleshooting: please read [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/squiggly-clojure#debugging-and-bug-reporting][debugging and bug reporting]] and try to reproduce using the [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/squiggly-clojure/tree/master/sample-project][sample project]].

*** Enable multiple linters
You can choose to enable multiple linters and have them all run together. This gives you better linting coverage, as they don't catch all the same issues.

You will need to follow their individual install instructions first, to get all their necessary binaries and configs on the system PATH that =spacemacs.env= includes. Please refer to their individual Enable ... linter section respectively.

Once all the linters you want to enable are installed, you simply need to specify a list of them in the =:variables= option to your Spacemacs configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Witout any variables your configuration would just include clojure
  dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
  '(...
    clojure
    )

  ;; to enable multiple linters, say clj-kondo and joker, add a list variable to the clojure layer
  ;; listing each one in the order you want them running, wrapping the clojure layer in a list
  dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
  '(...
    (clojure :variables
             clojure-enable-linters '(clj-kondo joker))
    )
#+END_SRC

*** Enable Clojure fancify Symbols
Fancify symbols re-writes your code and displays symbols for:
- function definitions with fn =(λ [a] (+ a 5))= and its syntax shortcut =ƒ(+ % 5)=
- set literals =∈{2 4 6}=
- partial functions =Ƥ=.

To enable this feature, add the following snippet to the
=dotspacemacs/user-config= section of your =~/.spacemacs= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq clojure-enable-fancify-symbols t)
#+END_SRC

Or set this variable when loading the configuration layer:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
  '((clojure :variables clojure-enable-fancify-symbols t)))
#+END_SRC

*** Enabling sayid or clj-refactor
The packages sayid (Clojure debugger) and clj-refactor (automatic refactorings)
are disabled by default. These packages are less active that the CIDER project
and may cause issues when running CIDER.

To enable them, add a =:variables= option when enabling the =clojure= layer,
specifying =clojure-enable-sayid=, or =clojure-enable-clj-refactor=, or both.

In your Spacemacs configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; before
  dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
  '(...
    clojure
    )

  ;; after
  dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
  '(...
    (clojure :variables
             clojure-enable-sayid t
             clojure-enable-clj-refactor t)
    )
#+END_SRC

Enabling either of these packages will cause extra nREPL middleware to be
injected when jacking in CIDER.

If you are experiencing issues when running a REPL, try disabling these
packages first and restart Spacemacs to see if the error persists.

* Usage
Read the key bindings section to see all the functionality available, or simply
use the ~,~ or ~SPC m~ to open the which-key menu for the Clojure layer.

** Starting a REPL from Spacemacs
Open a Clojure file (=.clj=, =.cljs=, =.cljc=, =.edn=) and start a Clojure REPL,
choosing the REPL session type (Clojure, ClojureScript or both Clojure & ClojureScript).

~, '~ and ~, s i~ calls the ~sesman-start~ command, a wrapper for all the
~jack-in~ and ~connect~ commands. A prompt appears allowing you to choose the
type of REPL session required.

~, s j~ opens the cider-jack-in menu, providing commands to start specific REPL sessions,
it is the same as using the ~sesman-start~ command described previously.

Using the universal constant, ~SPC u~ before any of the previous commands enables editing
of the command that starts the REPL. This is useful if you want to add a =deps.edn= alias
or add your own dependencies to inject. The command is edited in the mini-buffer

Once the REPL starts, a confirmation message is displayed in the mini-buffer.

The REPL buffer does not open automatically (Clojure is typically evaluated in
the source code buffer). ~, s a~ will switch between REPL and source code buffers,
opening the REPL buffer if not already shown.

*** Troubleshooting
If the REPL does not start, ~SPC b m~ opens the message buffer and should show errors.
Also check the REPL buffer, ~, s a~ for error messages.

Remove optional features from the Clojure layer, specifically sayid and clj-refactor.
Restart Emacs and confirm the issue still occurs.

Visit [[https://clojurians.slack.com/messages/cider][#cider channel on Clojurians Slack community]] for help with CIDER,
and [[https://clojurians.slack.com/messages/spacemacs][#spacemacs channel]] for Spacemacs specific help

** Connecting to a Clojure REPL outside of Emacs
Start a REPL outside of Emacs that includes an nREPL server. The IP address and port
the nREPL runs on should be printed.

~, '_~ or ~SPC m s i~ displays the sesman prompt, select the connect command relevant
to the type of REPL you wish to start.

~, s c~ opens the cider-connect menu, providing key bindings for connecting too the
different REPL session types.

CIDER communicates with your Clojure process through nREPL and for CIDER to
function correctly extra nREPL middleware is needed (cider/cider-nrepl).
The same is true for clj-refactor (refactor-nrepl), and for sayid (com.billpiel/sayid).

When starting the Clojure process through cider (=cider-jack-in= and friends)
this will be handled automatically, and so most users should be able to just run
~SPC m s i~ to connect to the CIDER REPL and skip the rest of this section.

If you are running an older version of CIDER (0.10 or older), or if you are
starting the Clojure process yourself outside of Emacs, then you need to make
sure the necessary dependencies are present, and the necessary nREPL middlewares
are enabled.

*** Quick Start with boot
- Install =boot= 2.8.2 or newer (see [[https://github.com/boot-clj/boot#user-content-install]])
- Create a file =~/.boot/profile.boot= with the following content:

  #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (require 'boot.repl)

    (swap! boot.repl/*default-dependencies* conj
           ;; When running an older version of CIDER (pre 0.18), use the
           ;; version that best matches M-x cider-version. For versions since
           ;; 0.18.0 use whatever version is the most recent.
           '[cider/cider-nrepl "0.21.1"]

           ;; Only necessary when using clj-refactor
           '[refactor-nrepl "2.4.0"]

           ;; Only necessary when using sayid
           '[com.billpiel/sayid "0.0.17"])

    (swap! boot.repl/*default-middleware* conj
           'cider.nrepl/cider-middleware
           'refactor-nrepl.middleware/wrap-refactor
           'com.billpiel.sayid.nrepl-middleware/wrap-sayid)
  #+END_SRC

*** Quick Start with lein
- Install =lein= version 2.9.0 or newer (see [[https://leiningen.org/#install]])
- Create a file =~/.lein/profiles.clj= with the following content:

  #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    {:repl
     {:plugins [;; When running an older version of CIDER (pre 0.18), use the
                ;; version that best matches M-x cider-version. For versions since
                ;; 0.18.0 use whatever version is the most recent.
                [cider/cider-nrepl "0.21.1"]

                ;; Only necessary when using clj-refactor
                [refactor-nrepl "2.4.0"]

                ;; Only necessary when using sayid
                [com.billpiel/sayid "0.0.17"]]

      :dependencies [[nrepl "0.4.5"]]

      :repl-options
      {:nrepl-middleware [refactor-nrepl.middleware/wrap-refactor ;; clj-refactor
                          com.billpiel.sayid.nrepl-middleware/wrap-sayid ;; sayid
                          ]}}}
  #+END_SRC

*** More details
More info regarding installation of nREPL middleware can be found here:
- CIDER: [[https://cider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/][CIDER installation (official docs)]]
- clj-refactor: [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/refactor-nrepl][refactor-nrepl]]

** Managing REPL connections
Sesman is used for [[https://docs.cider.mx/cider/usage/managing_connections.html][managing REPL connections]] when working simultaneously on
multiple projects or have multiple connections opened for the same project

~SPC m m i~ provides information about the current REPL.
~SPC m m b~ shows information about all REPLs currently active.
~SPC m m l~ menu links files, directories and projects to an existing session.

See REPL connections in the key bindings section for all the commands.

** Cheatsheet
This layers installs the [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-cheatsheet][clojure-cheatsheet]] package which embeds this useful
[[https://clojure.org/api/cheatsheet][cheatsheet]] into Emacs.

Type ~SPC m h c~ to display the cheatsheet then type in some terms (space
separated) to narrow down the list. For example, try typing in sort map to see
some functions that deal with sorting maps.

** Structuraly safe editing
The Clojure layer adds support for =evil-cleverparens= which allows to safely edit
lisp code by keeping the s-expressions balanced.

~SPC m T s~ will toggle safe structured editing, off by default.

Enable safe structural editing for all =clojure= buffers using the following
in the =dotspacemacs/user-config= function of your .spacemacs file

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (spacemacs/toggle-evil-safe-lisp-structural-editing-on-register-hook-clojure-mode)
#+END_SRC

Or enable safe structural editing for all supported modes:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (spacemacs/toggle-evil-safe-lisp-structural-editing-on-register-hooks)
#+END_SRC

When enabled the symbol =🆂= will display in the mode-line.

* Key bindings
** Working with clojure files (barfage, slurpage & more)
Spacemacs comes with a special =lisp-state= for working with lisp code that
supports slurpage, barfage and more tools you'll likely want when working with
lisp.

As this state works the same for all files, the documentation is in global
[[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/doc/DOCUMENTATION.org#lisp-key-bindings][DOCUMENTATION.org]]. In general, use ~SPC k~ to interact with the lisp-state.

** Indentation
With a [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/blob/master/doc/modules/ROOT/pages/indent_spec.adoc][Indentation spec]] functionality of Cider to read the custom indentation rules from the
var's metadata, it is better for consistency reasons to not add the custom
indentation rules to Spacemacs, but to add them to the metadata of those
specific vars.
