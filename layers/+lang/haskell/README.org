* Description
This layer adds support for the [[https://www.haskell.org/][Haskell]] language.

** Features:
- auto-completion with [[https://github.com/iquiw/company-ghc][company-ghc]],
- syntax highlighting for [[https://github.com/bgamari/cmm-mode][C-- source]].

*This layer is in construction, it needs your contributions and bug reports.*

* Install
** Layer
To use this contribution add it to your =~/.spacemacs=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(haskell))
#+END_SRC

** Dependencies
This layer requires some [[https://www.haskell.org/cabal/][cabal]] packages:
- =hlint=
- =stylish-haskell=
- =hasktags=

You can install them using =cabal= or =stack=. =Cabal= users should use
following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ cabal install stylish-haskell hlint hasktags
#+END_SRC

=Stack= users should use following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ stack install stylish-haskell hlint hasktags
#+END_SRC

** Setup PATH

First of all make sure that your =$PATH= contains installation path for Haskell
tools like =ghc=, =ghci= etc. It depends on how you have installed =ghc=. But
you can always check it by calling =$ which ghc= in your terminal. =Stack= users
should add only installation path of =stack= itself, usually it's
=~/.local/bin=.

Then make sure that your =$PATH= contains installation path for =cabal=
packages. If you are using =cabal= it should be =~/.cabal/bin= or
=/Users/<username>/Library/Haskell/bin= (for 'Haskell for Mac' users). If you
are using =stack= then it should be =~/.local/bin=.

For information about setting up =$PATH=, checkout corresponding section in FAQ
(~SPC f e h $PATH RET~).

** OS X
Note that =emacs.app= for OS X does not pick up =$PATH= from =~/.bashrc= or
=~/.zshrc= when launched from outside a terminal.

** Optional extras
The Haskell layer supports some extra features that can be enabled through
layer variables.

*** ghc-mod support
[[http://www.mew.org/~kazu/proj/ghc-mod/][ghc-mod]] enhances =haskell-mode= with for example templates, case-splitting and
much more. In order to use it you need to install the executable with

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ cabal install ghc-mod
#+END_SRC

=Stack= users should use following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ stack install ghc-mod --resolver nightly-2015-10-07
#+END_SRC

and set the layer variable:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    '((haskell :variables haskell-enable-ghc-mod-support t)))
#+END_SRC

=Stack= users also should make sure that =dist/setup-config= doesn't exist in
the project root. As it will confuse =ghc-mod=. For more troubleshooting,
checkout this [[https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/ghc-mod/wiki#known-issues-related-to-stack][document]].

*** GHCi-ng support
[[https://github.com/chrisdone/ghci-ng][ghci-ng]] adds some nice features to =haskell-mode=, and is supported in
Spacemacs by a layer variable:

Follow the instructions to install [[https://github.com/chrisdone/ghci-ng][ghci-ng]] (remember to add =:set +c=
in =~/.ghci=, next set the layer variable:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    '((haskell :variables haskell-enable-ghci-ng-support t)))
#+END_SRC

Once ghci-ng is enabled, two of the old keybindings are overriden with
improved versions from ghci-ng, and a new keybinding available:

| Key Binding | Description                                                               |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC m h t~ | gets the type of the identifier under the cursor or for the active region |
| ~SPC m g g~ | go to definition                                                          |
| ~SPC m u~   | finds uses of identifier                                                  |

*** structured-haskell-mode
[[https://github.com/chrisdone/structured-haskell-mode][structured-haskell-mode]], or shm, replaces default haskell-mode
auto-indentation and adds some nice functionalities.

To Install =shm= with cabal run following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ cabal install structured-haskell-mode
#+END_SRC

=Stack= users should use following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ stack install structured-haskell-mode
#+END_SRC

To enable =shm= set the layer variable:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    '((haskell :variables haskell-enable-shm-support t)))
#+END_SRC

After shm has been enabled, some of the evil normal state bindings are overridden:

| Key Binding | Description         |
|-------------+---------------------|
| ~D~         | =shm/kill-line=     |
| ~R~         | =shm/raise=         |
| ~P~         | =shm/yank=          |
| ~(~         | =shm/forward-node=  |
| ~)~         | =shm/backward-node= |

For a nice visualization of these functions, please refer to the github page
for [[https://github.com/chrisdone/structured-haskell-mode#features][structured-haskell-mode]].

*** hindent
[[https://github.com/chrisdone/hindent][hindent]] is an extensible Haskell pretty printer, which let's you
reformat your code. You need to install the executable with =cabal
install hindent= or =stack install hindent=

To enable it you have to set the variable =haskell-enable-hindent-style=
to a supported style. The available styles are:
- fundamental
- johan-tibell
- chris-done
- gibiansky

See examples [[https://github.com/chrisdone/hindent#example][here]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    '((haskell :variables haskell-enable-hindent-style "johan-tibell")))
#+END_SRC

* FAQ

** REPL doesn't work
Usually =haskell-mode= is great at figuring out which interactive process to
bring up. But if you are experiencing problems with it you can help
=haskell-mode= by setting =haskell-process-type= as in following code:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
    '((haskell :variables haskell-process-type 'stack-ghci)))
#+END_SRC

Available options are:

- ghci
- cabal-repl
- cabal-dev
- cabal-ghci
- stack-ghci

** REPL is stuck
Make sure that when you are typing anything in REPL there is a space between
what you type and =λ>=. When there is no space - REPL will behave as it's stuck.
Usually, when you enter normal state, cursor is moved back, so there is no
required space when you switch to insert mode. There is possible workaround -
just add following snippet to your =dotspacemacs/user-config= function:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (configuration-layer/layer-usedp 'haskell)
    (add-hook 'haskell-interactive-mode-hook
              (lambda ()
                (setq-local evil-move-cursor-back nil))))
#+END_SRC

It will make cursor stay at the right place in the REPL buffer when you enter
normal state. Which in most cases helps you to avoid the problem with 'stuck'
REPL.

Also, some users might want to start REPL in insert mode. For this to happen you
could place following snippet in your =dotspacemacs/user-config= function:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(when (configuration-layer/layer-usedp 'haskell)
    (defadvice haskell-interactive-switch (after spacemacs/haskell-interactive-switch-advice activate)
      (when (eq dotspacemacs-editing-style 'vim)
        (call-interactively 'evil-insert))))
#+END_SRC

** I am using =stack= and =ghc-mod=, but =ghc-mod= doesn't work
Make sure that =dist= directory doesn't exist in your project root. So if it
exists, just remove it and try again.
