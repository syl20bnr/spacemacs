* Description
Spacemacs is not just emacs+vim. It can have OSX keybindings too!
This layer globally defines common OSX keybindings. ~⌘~ is set to
~super~ and ~⌥~ is set to ~meta~. Aside from that, there's nothing
much, really.

While in =dired= this layer will try to use =gls= instead of =ls=.

* Philosophy
While this layer enables common OSX bindings, it does not implement
OSX navigation keybindings. Spacemacs is meant to be used with evil,
and we encourage you to do so :)

* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =osx= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

*** Use with non-US keyboard layouts
If you need the ~⌥~ key to type common characters such as ={[]}~= which is usual
for e.g. Finnish and Swedish keyboard layouts, you'll probably want to leave the
~⌥~ key unchanged by setting the =osx-use-option-as-meta= variable to =nil=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
     (osx :variables osx-use-option-as-meta nil)))
#+END_SRC

If you have problem entering symbols that are behind the ~⌥~ key you may want to
added this to the user-init in the .spacemacs-File. This will allow you to use
the right ~⌥~ key to write symbols. The left ~⌥~ key can be used as the Meta
key.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default mac-right-option-modifier nil)
#+END_SRC

** Coreutils
To get =gls= install coreutils homebrew:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install coreutils
#+END_SRC

* Key Bindings

| Key Binding | Description       |
|-------------+-------------------|
| ~⌘ =~       | Scale up text     |
| ~⌘ -~       | Scale down text   |
| ~⌘ q~       | Quit              |
| ~⌘ v~       | Paste             |
| ~⌘ c~       | Copy              |
| ~⌘ x~       | Cut               |
| ~⌘ a~       | Select all        |
| ~⌘ w~       | Close window      |
| ~⌘ W~       | Close frame       |
| ~⌘ n~       | New frame         |
| ~⌘ z~       | Undo              |
| ~⌘ Z~       | Redo              |
| ~⌃ ⌘ f~     | Toggle fullscreen |

* Future Work
- Allow user to choose from either ~hyper~ or ~super~ as ~⌘~. This is an option
  that is supported cross-platform.
- Configurable option to keep the OSX and spacemacs clipboards separate
