* Description
This layer provides auto-completion to Spacemacs.

The following completion engines are supported:
- [[http://company-mode.github.io/][company]]
- [[http://auto-complete.org/][auto-complete]]

Snippets are supported via [[https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet][yasnippet]] and [[https://github.com/abo-abo/auto-yasnippet][auto-yasnippet]].

This layer also configures =hippie-expand=.

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =auto-completion= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

* Configuration
** Key bindings
You can customize the user experience of auto-completion with the following
layer variables:

1. =auto-completion-return-key-behavior= set the action to perform when the
   ~RET~ key is pressed, the possible values are:
   - =complete= completes with the current selection
   - =nil= does nothing

2. =auto-completion-tab-key-behavior= set the action to perform when the ~TAB~
   key is pressed, the possible values are:
   - =complete= completes with the current selection
   - =cycle= completes the common prefix and cycle between candidates
   - =nil= does nothing

3. =auto-completion-complete-with-key-sequence= is a string of two characters
   denoting a key sequence that will perform a =complete= action if the sequence
   as been entered quickly enough. If its value is =nil= then the feature is
   disabled.

4. =auto-completion-private-snippets-directory= is a path or list of paths to
   your private snippets directory. If its value is =nil= then the spacemacs
   default (=~/.emacs.d/private/snippets=) is used.

The default configuration of the layer is:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
  (auto-completion :variables
                   auto-completion-return-key-behavior 'complete
                   auto-completion-tab-key-behavior 'cycle
                   auto-completion-complete-with-key-sequence nil
                   auto-completion-private-snippets-directory nil)
                   ))
#+END_SRC

~jk~ is a good candidate for =auto-completion-complete-with-key-sequence= if
you don't use it already.

** Tooltips
To enable docstring tooltips set =auto-completion-enable-help-tooltip= to =t=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
  '(auto-completion :variables
                    auto-completion-enable-help-tooltip t))
#+END_SRC

** Sort results by usage
To enable sorting auto-completion results by their usage frequency set
=auto-completion-enable-sort-by-usage= to =t=.
This feature is provided by the [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-statistics][company-statistics]] package when =company=
is used.
The variable has no effect when =auto-complete= is used.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
  '(auto-completion :variables
                    auto-completion-enable-sort-by-usage t))
#+END_SRC

** Show snippets in auto-completion popup
By default, snippets are not shown in the auto-completion popup. To show them in
the popup, set the variable =auto-completion-enable-snippets-in-popup= to =t=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
                '((auto-completion :variables
                                   auto-completion-enable-snippets-in-popup t))
#+END_SRC

** Enable company or auto-complete globally
By default Spacemacs enables auto-completion explicitly for each supported
major-mode, it means that =company= and =auto-complete= are not enabled
globally, it allows more flexibility to choose an auto-completion engine
for a given mode.

You may want to enable company globally to get auto-completion
everywhere even in the modes which are not configured by Spacemacs. To do
so, you just have to add =(global-company-mode)= in the
=dotspacemacs/user -config= function of your dotfile.

Note that if you want to enable =auto-complete= globally you will have to
disable =company= first, see the next section to do so.

** Replacing company by auto-complete
You can disable =company= by adding it to the =dotspacemacs-excluded-packages=
variable, then you are free to enable =auto-complete= globally.

** Add auto-completion in a layer
Here is an example to add =company= auto-completion to python buffer:

*** In =config.el=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Define the buffer local company backend variable
  (spacemacs|defvar-company-backends python-mode)
#+END_SRC

*** In =packages.el=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Add the relevant packages to the layer
  (setq python-packages
    '(...
      company
      company-anaconda
      ...))

  ;; Configure the packages
  (when (configuration-layer/layer-usedp 'auto-completion)

    ;; Hook company to python-mode
    (defun python/post-init-company ()
      (spacemacs|add-company-hook python-mode))

    ;; Add the backend to the major-mode specific backend list
    (defun python/init-company-anaconda ()
      (use-package company-anaconda
        :if (configuration-layer/package-usedp 'company)
        :defer t
        :init (push 'company-anaconda company-backends-python-mode))))
#+END_SRC
