* Description
This layer enables Helm everywhere in Spacemacs. The alternative to this
layer is the Ivy layer which brings the same level of integration as Helm.

These completion systems are the central control towers of Spacemacs, they are
used to manage buffers, projects, search results, configuration layers, toggles
and more...

Mastering your choice of completion system will make you a Spacemacs power user.

* Install
Helm is the default completion framework -- if Ivy is not enabled, Helm will be
enabled automatically.

To switch from Ivy to Helm, modify your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to add
=helm= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this file,
and remove =ivy=.

* Key bindings
** hjkl navigation
When using the Vim style or Hybrid style with the variable
=hybrid-mode-enable-hjkl-bindings= set to =t=, Spacemacs adds navigation in the
Helm buffers with ~hjkl~.

| Key Binding | Description                  |
|-------------+------------------------------|
| ~C-h~       | go to next source            |
| ~C-H~       | describe key (replace ~C-h~) |
| ~C-j~       | go to previous candidate     |
| ~C-k~       | go to next candidate         |
| ~C-l~       | same as ~return~             |

** Transient state
Spacemacs defines a transient state for =Helm= to make it work like [[https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim][Vim's Unite]]
plugin.

Initiate the transient state with ~M-SPC~ or ~s-M-SPC~ while in a =Helm= buffer.

| Key Binding          | Description                                          |
|----------------------+------------------------------------------------------|
| ~M-SPC~ or ~s-M-SPC~ | initiate the transient state                         |
| ~q~                  | quit transient state                                 |
| ~TAB~                | switch to actions page and leave the transient state |
| ~1~                  | execute action 0                                     |
| ~2~                  | execute action 1                                     |
| ~3~                  | execute action 2                                     |
| ~4~                  | execute action 3                                     |
| ~5~                  | execute action 4                                     |
| ~6~                  | execute action 5                                     |
| ~7~                  | execute action 6                                     |
| ~8~                  | execute action 7                                     |
| ~9~                  | execute action 8                                     |
| ~0~                  | execute action 9                                     |
| ~a~                  | switch to actions page                               |
| ~g~                  | go to first candidate                                |
| ~G~                  | go to last candidate                                 |
| ~h~                  | go to previous source                                |
| ~j~                  | select next candidate                                |
| ~k~                  | select previous candidate                            |
| ~l~                  | go to next source                                    |
| ~t~                  | mark current candidate                               |
| ~T~                  | mark all candidates                                  |
| ~v~                  | execute persistent action                            |

** Bookmarks
In the =helm-bookmarks= buffer:

| Key Binding | Description                                  |
|-------------+----------------------------------------------|
| ~C-d~       | delete the selected bookmark                 |
| ~C-e~       | edit the selected bookmark                   |
| ~C-f~       | toggle filename location                     |
| ~C-o~       | open the selected bookmark in another window |

** C-z and Tab switch
The command bound to ~C-z~ is much more useful than the one bound to Tab, so it
makes sense to swap them. It's also recommended [[http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html][here]].

** Helm focus
If you find yourself unable to return focus to Helm (after a careless
mouse-click for example), use ~SPC w b~ to return focus to the minibuffer.

** Helm-swoop
[[https://github.com/ShingoFukuyama/helm-swoop][Helm-swoop]] is very similar to =moccur=, it displays a =helm= buffer with all the
occurrences of the word under point. You can then change the search query in
real-time and navigate between them easily.

You can even edit the occurrences directly in the =helm= buffer and apply the
modifications to the buffer.

| Key Binding | Description                    |
|-------------+--------------------------------|
| ~SPC s s~   | execute =helm-swoop=           |
| ~SPC s S~   | execute =helm-multi-swoop=     |
| ~SPC s C-s~ | execute =helm-multi-swoop-all= |

** Universal argument

~SPC u~ is not working before =helm-M-x= (~SPC SPC~). Instead, call =helm-M-x=
first, select the command you want to run, and press ~C-u~ before pressing
~RETURN~. For instance: ~SPC SPC org-reload C-u RET~

** Replacing text in several files
If you have =rg=, =ag=, =pt= or =ack= installed, replacing an occurrence of text
in several files can be performed via [[https://github.com/syohex/emacs-helm-ag][helm-ag]].

Say you want to replace all =foo= occurrences by =bar= in your current
project:
  - initiate a search with ~SPC /~
  - enter in edit mode with ~C-c C-e~
  - go to the occurrence and enter in =iedit state= with ~SPC s e~
  - edit the occurrences then leave the =iedit state=
  - press ~C-c C-c~

*Note*: In Spacemacs, =helm-ag= despite its name works with =rg=, =pt= and =ack=
as well (but not with =grep=).

** Resume last session
Use ~SPC r l~ to resume the last helm session. For instance it is handy to
quickly toggle on and off a toggle using ~SPC h t~.
