* Description
Spacemacs is powered by one of two incremental completion and selection
narrowing frameworks: [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] (this layer, which is the default) or Ivy.

These completion systems are the central control towers of Spacemacs, they are
used to manage buffers, projects, search results, configuration layers, toggles
and more...

Mastering your choice of completion system will make you a Spacemacs power user.

* Install
Helm is the default completion framework -- if Ivy is not enabled, Helm will be
enabled automatically.

To switch from Ivy to Helm, modify your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to add
=helm= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this file,
and remove =ivy=.

* Key bindings
The Spacemacs-specific keybindings are described in the Spacemacs documentation:
- [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/doc/DOCUMENTATION.org#helm][Navigating Helm buffers]]

* External resources
- [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki][The Helm wiki]]
