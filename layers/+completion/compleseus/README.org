* Description
This layer implements completion provided by combining the following packages:
- =selectrum= or =vertico=: vertical completion user interface
- =consult=: useful commands using ~completing-read~
- =embark=: provides minibuffer actions
- =marginalia=: annotations to completion candidates
- =orderless=: filtering enhancements

It only supports emacs 27 or later.

** Features:
- Similar features like =ivy= or =helm=

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=: You will need to
add =compleseus= to the =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this file.

Make sure that the other completion layers: =helm= and =ivy= are removed or
commented out in the =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list. Or add
=compleseus= below the other completion layers. Spacemacs uses the completion
layer that's listed last.

** Configuration
*** Completion engine
You can configure the completion engine by setting =compleseus-engine= to either
=vertico= (default) or =selectrum= by editing the =compleseus-engine= variable
like below to use =selectrum= as opposed to the default of =vertico=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (compleseus :variables
              compleseus-engine 'selectrum)
#+END_SRC

* Key bindings

| Key binding | Description               |
|-------------+---------------------------|
| ~M-o~       | embark-action             |
| ~C-r~       | history                   |
| ~M-.~       | preview selected item now |

** Edit consult buffer

| Key binding            | Description                                                                    |
|------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~C-c C-e~              | Export consult buffer to a grep buffer and make it editable right away         |
| ~M-o E~                | Export consult buffer to a new buffer (usually grep)                           |
| ~SPC m w~              | Toggle the exported buffer to be editable or read-only when it's a grep buffer |
| ~SPC m ,~ or ~SPC m c~ | Apply/Commit changes made in the exported buffer                               |
| ~SPC m a~ or ~SPC m k~ | Abort/Kill changes made in the exported buffer                                 |
| ~SPC m q~              | Abort/Kill changes made in the exported buffer and close the buffer            |
| ~SPC m s~              | Apply and =save= changes made in the exported buffer and close the buffer      |

Note: ~SPC m s~ actually saves the changes on disk when the changed lines belong
to a buffer visiting a file. ~SPC m ,~ and ~SPC m c~ do not save the changes on
disk.
