* Description
This layer implements completion provided by combining the following packages:
- =selectrum= or =vertico=: vertical completion user interface
- =consult=: useful commands using ~completing-read~
- =embark=: provides minibuffer actions
- =marginalia=: annotations to completion candidates
- =orderless=: filtering enhancements

It only supports emacs 27 or later.

** Features:
- Similar features like =ivy= or =helm=

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=: You will need to
add =compleseus= to the =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this file.

Make sure that the other completion layers: =helm= and =ivy= are removed or
commented out in the =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list. Or add
=compleseus= below the other completion layers. Spacemacs uses the completion
layer that's listed last.

** Configuration
*** Completion engine
You can configure the completion engine by setting =compleseus-engine= to either
=vertico= (default) or =selectrum= by editing the =compleseus-engine= variable
like below to use =selectrum= as opposed to the default of =vertico=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

* Key bindings

| Key binding | Description                    |
|-------------+--------------------------------|
| ~M-o~       | embark-action                  |
| ~C-r~       | history                        |
| ~M-.~       | preview selected item now      |
| ~C-z~       | select embark action from list |

** Narrowing
Many consult commands support 'narrowing', whith allows you to type a key and narrow the list of candidates available
Once you have discovered the narrowing keys available, you can do them directly with ~key SPC~.
e.g. in ~compleseus/switch-to-buffer~ type ~* SPC~ to see only modified buffers.
Delete the narrowing key again to return to all selections.

|-------------+--------------------------------------------------|
| ~<~         | View narrowing commands available                |
| ~C-left~    | Cycle left through narrowing commands available  |
| ~C-right~   | Cycle right through narrowing commands available |


** Edit consult buffer

| Key binding            | Description                                                                                                      |
|------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~C-c C-e~              | Export consult buffer to a grep buffer and make it editable right away                                           |
| ~M-o E~                | Export consult buffer to a new buffer (usually grep)                                                             |
| ~SPC m w~              | Toggle the exported buffer to be editable or read-only when it's a grep buffer                                   |
| ~SPC m ,~ or ~SPC m c~ | Apply/Commit changes made in the exported buffer                                                                 |
| ~SPC m a~ or ~SPC m k~ | Abort/Kill changes made in the exported buffer                                                                   |
| ~SPC m q~              | Abort/Kill changes made in the exported buffer and close the buffer                                              |
| ~SPC m s~              | Apply and =save= changes made in the exported buffer and close the buffer                                        |
| ~SPC m r~              | Toggle the read-only area (allowing you to remove lines from the wgrep buffer, won't be removed from the file)   |
| ~SPC m d~              | Mark the line to be deleted from the file                                                                        |
| ~SPC m f~              | Enable next-error-follow-minor-mode which will show previews of what you have under the cursor for a grep buffer |

Note: ~SPC m s~ actually saves the changes on disk when the changed lines belong
to a buffer visiting a file. ~SPC m ,~ and ~SPC m c~ do not save the changes on
disk.
