* Description
This layer implements completion provided by combining the following packages:
- =selectrum= or =vertico=: vertical completion user interface
- =consult=: useful commands using ~completing-read~
- =embark=: provides minibuffer actions
- =marginalia=: annotations to completion candidates
- =orderless=: filtering enhancements

It only supports emacs 27 or later.

** Features:
- Similar features like =ivy= or =helm=

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=: You will need to
add =compleseus= to the =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this file.

Make sure that the other completion layers: =helm= and =ivy= are removed or
commented out in the =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list. Or add
=compleseus= below the other completion layers. Spacemacs uses the completion
layer that's listed last.

** Configuration
*** Completion engine
You can configure the completion engine by setting =compleseus-engine= to either
=vertico= (default) or =selectrum= by editing the =compleseus-engine= variable
like below to use =selectrum= as opposed to the default of =vertico=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (compleseus :variables
              compleseus-engine 'selectrum)
#+END_SRC
