* Description

This layer adds functionality to preserve the state of scratch buffers across
Emacs sessions. The package recognizes buffers named like =*scratch*= as
persistent buffers reloaded on startup.  Buffers titled as =untitled=, as
created by default with Spacemacs =spacemacs/new-empty-buffer=, ~SPC b t~, will
not persist across sessions.   

Use binding ~SPC h s~ to show all open scratch buffers. 

* Install

To use this contribution layer add it to your =~/.spacemacs=
