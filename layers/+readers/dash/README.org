* Description
This layer integrates offline api browsers into Emacs. It provides one for OS X, Linux and Windows.

** Features:
- Searching for word at point in offline api browser's UI.
- Integration of offline api browser search results in helm and ivy.
- Support for [[https://kapeli.com/dash][dash]] offline api browser for OS X.
- Support for [[https://zealdocs.org/][zeal]] offline api browser for Linux.

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =dash= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

** Dash (OS X)
You have to install [[https://kapeli.com/dash][dash]] on your machine.

It is recommended to set the =HUD mode= in your Dash application preferences
when using this layer.

*** Sqlite3
Helm Dash [[https://github.com/areina/helm-dash#user-content-requirements][requires]] sqlite3 to be installed to function properly.

** Zeal (Linux & Windows)
You have to install [[https://zealdocs.org/][zeal]] on your machine.

Then install the docsets you use more frequently

* Configuration
By default, the dash layer will initialize all installed docsets to be active in
all buffers. To disable this and opt-in to specific docsets for specific buffers, set:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(dash :variables
      dash-autoload-common-docsets nil)
#+END_SRC

To change the location of the installed docsets, set:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(dash :variables
      helm-dash-docset-newpath "~/.docsets")
#+END_SRC

* Word at point
=dash-at-point= and =zeal-at-point= will search for the word at point in the respective offline api browser.
The result will be displayed in the offline browser's UI.

However having to leave emacs to have a look at the search results may be a bit awkward.
To help with this it is also possible to integrate the search results directly in =helm= or =ivy=
and show the details in a browser. To do so [[https://github.com/areina/helm-dash][helm-dash]] can be used for =helm= and [[https://github.com/nathankot/counsel-dash][counsel-dash]] for =ivy=.
