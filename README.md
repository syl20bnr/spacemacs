# Introduction

_You are a Vim user ?_

You do not need to know Emacs to use Spacemacs!

_You are an Emacs user ?_

You do not need to know Vim to use Spacemacs!

Since version 0.101.0 and later Spacemacs totally abolishes the frontiers
between Vim and Emacs. The user can now choose his/her preferred editing
style and enjoy all the Spacemacs features.

Even better, it is possible to dynamically switch between the two
styles _seamlessly_ which makes it possible for programmers with different
styles to do seat pair programming using the _same_ editor.

Since switching between the two styles is so simple, Spacemacs is the perfect
setup to learn the "other way" or even crazier, to get the best of both
worlds by developing your own hybrid style.

Spacemacs is also a user-friendly and well-documented Emacs kit that
integrates the best Emacs packages out there. It uses [Evil Mode][] to combine
the ergonomic editing features of Vim and Emacs with the flexibility of a
lisp powered engine.

If you are already an experienced Emacs user, you will appreciate the elegantly
customized system and carefully curated, tightly integrated, set of packages.

Spacemacs is currently in beta, and contributions are very welcome.

# Features

## Batteries Included

Spacemacs integrates hundreds of ready-to-use packages thanks to a
community-driven approach.

Those packages are grouped in [layers][] and their configuration follow a set
of rules gathered in [CONVENTIONS.md][].

**[Visit the Documentation][DOCUMENTATION.MD]**

## Nice UI

Spacemacs looks good. It ships with quality themes and a beautiful mode-line.

![spacemacs_python](doc/img/spacemacs-python.png)

## Excellent ergonomics

Spacemacs is designed around the [Evil Mode][] and a leader key. All the
packages are customized to integrate seamlessly with Evil.

Spacemacs also define micro-states to group related commands. These
micro-states reduce the keystrokes needed to issue repetitive commands and
reduce the number of keyboard bindings to learn.

## Convenient and Mnemonic Key Bindings

`Spacemacs` organizes key bindings into mnemonic groups. For example, commands
to operate on the buffer are prefixed by `<SPC> b`, and commands to operate on
the project are under `<SPC> p`.

### Great [Documentation][DOCUMENTATION.MD]

Most of Spacemacs' features, key bindings, and configuration options
are extensively documented.

If you need help, ask your question in the [Gitter Chat][] and a member of the
community will help you out.

If you prefer IRC, connect to the [Gitter Chat IRC server][] and join the
`#syl20bnr/spacemacs` channel.

# Prerequisites

## Emacs

`Spacemacs` is tested with Emacs 24.3 and 24.4 and therefore should boot
on all the major OSes where these versions are installable.

Some modes require third-party tools that you'll have to install via your
favorite package manager.

### Linux distros

Install Emacs from the package manager of your favorite Linux distribution.

### OS X

The recommended version for OS X is [emacs-mac-port][]. It can be installed
via [homebrew][] with the following commands:

```sh
$ brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
$ brew install emacs-mac
```

The default key handling is different from the official OS X port. To correct
this you can add the [osx layer][] to your [dotfile][] layer list:

```elisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(osx))
```

Note that the `emacs-mac-port` server behaves differently than the regular
Emacs server.
Details can be found on the emacs-mac-port [README][emacs-mac-port-server].

### Windows

Good quality builds can be found [on this page][emacs-for-windows]. It is
recommended to install the most stable build.

Be sure to declare a environment variable named `HOME` and pointing to
your user directory `C:\Users\<username>`. Then you can clone Spacemacs
in this directory.

Sometimes you'll get the following error when you first start Emacs:

```
The directory ~/.emacs.d/server is unsafe
```

To fix it change the owner of the directory `~/.emacs.d/server`:
  - from Properties select the Tab “Security”,
  - select the button “Advanced”,
  - select the Tab “Owner”
  - change the owner to your account name

Source: [Stackoverflow][so-server-unsafe]

For efficient searches we recommend to install `pt` [the platinum searcher][].
`pt` version 1.7.7 or higher is required.

# Install

1. If you have an existing Emacs configuration, back it up:

   ```sh
   cd ~
   mv .emacs.d .emacs.bak
   ```

2. Clone this repository _with its submodules_:

   ```sh
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
   ```

   `master` is the stable branch and is regularly updated. Switch to the `develop`
   branch if you want to use the bleeding-edge version.

3. Launch Emacs. Spacemacs will automatically install the packages it requires.

4. Restart Emacs to complete the installation.

If the mode-line turns red then be sure to visit the [troubleshooting][troubleshoot]
guide and consult the [FAQ](#faq).

## Spacemacs logo

If you are using Ubuntu and Unity then you can add the Spacemacs logo by
following the instructions [here][cpaulik-unity-icon].

# Update

Spacemacs currently requires manual updates using the following procedure:

1. Update Emacs packages by clicking (press `RET`) on the `[Update]` link of
the starting page.

2. Close Emacs and update the git repository:

   ```sh
   git pull --rebase
   git submodule sync; git submodule update
   ```

3. Restart Emacs to complete the upgrade.

## Update notification

For convenience an indicator is displayed in the mode-line whenever a new
version of `Spacemacs` is available.

           Symbol                     | Description
:------------------------------------:|----------------------------------
![git-new](doc/img/update-green.png)  | < 3 releases behind
![git-del](doc/img/update-orange.png) | < 5 releases behind
![git-mod](doc/img/update-red.png)    | >= 5  releases behind

**Note:**
A feature allowing update by merely clicking on the indicator will be implemented _soon_!

## Rollback

Should anything go wrong during an update, you can rollback ELPA packages to a
previous version. Click (press `RET`) on the `[Rollback]` link of the startup
page, choose a rollback slot.

Rollback slot names are dates with the following format `YYYY-MM-DD_HH.MM.SS`.
The date corresponds to the date of an update. The most recent slots are
listed first.

# Configuration

`Spacemacs` divides its configuration into self-contained units called
[configuration layers][config]. These layers are stacked on top of each other
to achieve a custom configuration.

`Spacemacs` uses the dotfile `~/.spacemacs` to control which layers to
load. Within this file you may also generally configure certain features.

## Configuration layers

A configuration layer is a directory containing at least the following files:

- `packages.el`: Defines and configures packages to be downloaded from Emacs
package repositories using `package.el`
- `extensions.el`: Configures packages which cannot be downloaded with
  `package.el` such as built-in Emacs features and git submodules.

If you already have your own `Emacs` configuration you can move it to your
own layer.

The following command creates a layer in the `private` directory:

    <SPC> : configuration-layer/create-layer RET

Any configuration layers you create must be explicitly loaded in `~/.spacemacs`.

**Note:** For your privacy, the contents of the `private` directory are not
under source control. See the documentation for a discussion on how to
[manage your private configuration][manage_config].

## Dotfile (.spacemacs)

As mentioned `.spacemacs` controls which configuration layers to load and
is also a means to customizing `Spacemacs`.

The following command will create a `.spacemacs` file in your home directory:

    <SPC> : dotspacemacs/install RET

...to open the installed dotfile:

    <SPC> f e d

...to load some configuration layers using the variable
`dotspacemacs-configuration-layers`:

```elisp
;; List of configuration layers to load.
dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(auto-completion smex)
```

Some configuration layers support configuration variables to expose granular
control over layer-specific features, [git layer][] being one such example.
Variables can be directly set within `dotspacemacs-configuration-layers` like so:

```elisp
;; List of configuration layers to load.
dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(auto-completion
                                    (git :variables
                                         git-magit-status-fullscreen t
                                         git-enable-github-support t
                                         git-gutter-use-fringe t)
                                    smex)
```

At anytime you can apply the changes made to the dotfile or layers
_without restarting_ `Spacemacs` by pressing <kbd>SPC f e R</kbd>.

The [comments in this file][dotfile template] contain further information about
how to customize `Spacemacs`. See the [dotfile configuration][dotfile] section of
the documentation for more details.

# Learning Spacemacs

## Editing Styles

Spacemacs can be used by Vim users or Emacs users by setting the
`dotspacemacs-editing-style` variable to `'vim` or `'emacs` in the dotfile
`~/.spacemacs`.

## The leader keys

`Spacemacs` key bindings use a leader key which is by default bound to
<kbd>SPC</kbd> (space bar) in `vim` editing style and <kbd>M-m</kbd> in
`emacs` style.

You can change it by setting the variable `dotspacemacs-leader-key` if
you use the `vim` style or `dotspacemacs-emacs-leader-key` if you use
the `emacs` style (these variables must be set in the file `~/.spacemacs`).

For simplicity the documentation always refers to the leader key as
<kbd>SPC</kbd>.

There is secondary leader key called the major-mode leader key which is
set to <kbd>,</kbd> by default. This key is a shortcut for <kbd>SPC m</kbd>
where all the major-mode specific commands are bound.

## Evil-tutor

If you are willing to learn the Vim key bindings (highly recommended since
you can benefit from them even in `emacs` style), press <kbd>SPC h T</kbd>
to begin an Evil-adapted Vimtutor.

## Universal argument

In `vim` editing style the universal argument defaults to `<SPC> u`
instead of `C-u` because the latter is used to scroll up as in Vim.

## Configuration layers and Package discovery

By using `helm-spacemacs` with <kbd>SPC f e h</kbd> you can quickly search
for a package and get the name of the layers using it.

You can also easily go to the `README.md` of a layer or go to the initialization
function of a package.

## Key bindings discovery

Thanks to [guide-key][], whenever a prefix command is pressed (like `<SPC>`)
a buffer appears after one second listing the possible keys for this prefix.

It is also possible to search for specific key bindings by pressing:

    <SPC> ?

To narrow the bindings list to those prefixed with `<SPC>`,
type a pattern like this regular expression:

    SPC\ b

which would list all `buffer` related bindings.

## Describe functions

`Describe functions` are powerful Emacs introspection commands to get information
about functions, variables, modes etc. These commands are bound thusly:

Key Binding   |                 Description
--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------
`<SPC> h d f` | describe-function
`<SPC> h d k` | describe-key
`<SPC> h d m` | describe-mode
`<SPC> h d v` | describe-variable

# How-To's

Some quick `how-to's` are compiled in the [HOWTOs.md][] file.

# Contributions

`Spacemacs` needs _you_!

We especially need to create more configuration layers that, for instance, bring
support for new languages.

If you are ready to contribute please begin by consulting the
[contribution guidelines][CONTRIBUTE.md] and [conventions][CONVENTIONS.md],
thanks!

# FAQ

## Common

1. **Which version of Spacemacs am I running ?**
The version is displayed on the upper right corner of the loading screen.
You may also just type <kbd>SPC f e v</kbd>.

2. **What is the official pronunciation of Spacemacs ?**
As it is written, that is _space_ then _macs_.

3. **Why are packages installed with `package-install` automatically deleted by
Spacemacs when it boots ?**
To declare new packages you have to create a new configuration layer, see
the [quick start guide](#configuration).

4. **The Spacemacs banner is ugly, what should I do ?**
Install the default font supported by Spacemacs or choose a fixed width font.
More information in the [font section][] of the documentation.

5. **The powerline separators are ugly, how can I fix them ?**
Use the property `:powerline-scale` of the variable
`dotspacemacs-default-font`. See [font section][] documentation for more details.

6. **The powerline separators have no anti-aliasing, what can I do ?**
Emacs powerline uses XMP images to draw the separators in a graphical
environment. You can have anti-aliasing if you use the `utf8` separator.
Note that by default the `utf8` separator is used in a terminal.
See the powerline section in the [documentation][powerline-doc].

7. **Why is after-init-hook not executed ?**
Don't launch Spacemacs with `emacs -q -l init.el` command. This command will
run the hooked function in `after-init-hook` before the evaluation of the
passed `-l init.el` file.

## Windows

1. **Why do the fonts look crappy on Windows ?**
You can install [MacType][] on Windows to get very nice looking fonts. It is
also recommended to disable smooth scrolling on Windows.

2. **Why is there no Spacemacs logo in the startup buffer ?**
A GUI build of emacs supporting image display is required.
You can follow the instructions [here][Windows Image Support]. Alternatively you
can download binaries of emacs with image support
included such as [this one][emacs-for-windows].

## OS X

1. **Why are the powerline colors not correct on OS X ?**
This is a [known issue][powerline-srgb-issue] as of Emacs 24.4 due to
`ns-use-srgb-colorspace` defaulting to true. It is recommended to use
the [emacs-mac-port][] build. See the [install OSX section][] for more
details.
