;; Before Emacs 27, the init file was responsible for initializing the package
;; manager by calling `package-initialize'. Emacs 27 changed the default
;; behavior: It now calls `package-initialize' before loading the init file.
;; This behavior would prevent Spacemacs's own package initialization from
;; running. However, Emacs 27 also loads the "early init" file (this file)
;; before it initializes the package manager, and Spacemacs can use this early
;; init file to prevent Emacs from initializing the package manager. (See
;; <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=24acb31c04b4048b85311d794e600ecd7ce60d3b>.)
;;
;; Earlier Emacs versions do not load the early init file and do not initialize
;; the package manager before loading the init file, so this file is neither
;; needed nor loaded on those versions.
