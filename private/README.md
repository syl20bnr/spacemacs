# Private repository

The content of this directory is ignored by Git. This is the default place
where to store your private configuration layers.

To create a new configuration layer:

`<SPC> : spacemacs/create-configuration-layer`

Enter the name of your contribution in the prompt then `RET`

A directory named after the created configuration layer will be created here
along with template files within it.

Each file has further guidance written in them.

Once the configuration is done, restart Emacs to load, install and configure
your layer.
