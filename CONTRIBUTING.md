Spacemacs is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in. The community
makes Spacemacs what it is. We have a few guidelines, which we ask all
contributors to follow.

- If you want to ask a usage question, be sure to read [our documentation][], as
  it may hold the answer. You should also reference the `README.org` of the
  relevant layer(s). If your question is not answered there, then feel free to
  ask on our [gitter chat][].
- If you want to submit a Pull Request (PR), please read
  [our contribution guidelines][] before submitting. Also, make sure that your
  PR is against the `develop` branch, not `master` which should not be modified.
- If you are opening an issue, consider seeing if the bug has been fixed on
  `develop`, and that you are up to date by doing `git pull --rebase`. If it is
  not fixed, please include the output of `SPC h d s` in your bug report. This
  will include the following: OS, Emacs version, Spacemacs version, Spacemacs
  branch(`master` or `develop`), as well as current HEAD revision, distribution
  (`spacemacs` or `spacemacs-base`), and what layers you are using. This will
  help us to help you better.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
