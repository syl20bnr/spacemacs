             Spacemacs at your fingertips... in your browser!

Thanks to @JAremko's wonderful work, it is now possible to try out Spacemacs in
the browser.

Try it on your phone and be amazed that even without any modifier you can still
use Emacs thanks to the 'spacebar' and 'fd' available on any touch keyboard.

We are looking into useful applications of this feature, if you want to share some
ideas you can post on https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/8634 :heart:

                Go to http://spacemacs.org to test it now!
