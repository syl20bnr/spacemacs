1. Key binding changes

- `SPC l` for `avy-goto-line` is now under `SPC y`. `SPC l` is now for
  spacemacs layouts.

- `SPC a p` is now for `list-processes` and `SPC a P` for `proced`,
  `paradox` to list ELPA packages is now on `SPC a k`.

- `SPC s l` is now used to bring back last search buffer and `SPC s j`
  is for jumping into a file using `imenu` (was `SPC s l`).

- In home buffer, jumping to bookmark list is now on ~b~.

2. Magit

Magit key bindings have been revamped thanks to the official `evil-magit`
package. `evil-magit` provides a faithful port of Magit UX using Vim key
bindings. If you want to continue to use the old evilified bindings add
`evil-magit` package to the `dotspacemacs-excluded-packages` variable
of your dotfile.

3. Projectile

Caching is now disabled by default, while it should not break anything,
if you have some functions relying on caching being enabled be sure to
activate it explicitly with `(setq projectile-enable-caching t)`.

4. Ruby

The default major mode is now the Emacs built-in `ruby-mode`. If you want
to continue to use `enh-ruby-mode` set the layer variable
`ruby-enable-enh-ruby-mode` to `t`.
