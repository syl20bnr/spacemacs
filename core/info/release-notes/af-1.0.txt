               The new version of Spacemacs has arrived!

This version brings Emacs to a whole new level by embedding Zerovim technologies
through a state of the art message passing interface, this is Emacs for the next
next NEXT century.

This is so powerful that we decided to rename Spacemacs!

                       Zemacs: Emacs to THE MAX!

- Zerovim ambitious refactor of the (-1)Vim code base directly improves the code
quality of Emacs while still retaining its important [implementation tricks].

- Elisp can now be transpiled to   Vimscript which can be transpiled to Lua which
can be used to code plugins for Zerovim, so now Emacs can have true native Vim
plugins in Lua code coded in Elisp.
Note: For performance reasons native plugins are transpiled to Elisp before
being executed.

- You can now type in [Atom] in Emacs by sharing a Zerovim session. Zemacs is
shipped with a groundbreaking new UI using the new VR headsets capabilities:
by projecting the Atom web-based interface on the left eye and the Emacs
text-based interface on the right eye (also available the `swap-the-eyes' major
mode tailored for colour-blind people) we can create the perfect blend of Emacs
and Atom, instantaneous context switching with the blink of an eye. Welcome
to the definitive GUI:

       Zemacstom, the editor for the next next NEXT millennium.

This text is a parody of Neovim whose only purpose is to be funny (the text, not
Neovim!). Neovim is a popular fork of Vim, you can try it and contribute to it
by visiting this [link] or maybe [this one].

This prank will self-destruct the 2nd April 2016.
