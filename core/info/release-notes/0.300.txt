                       VERSION 0.300 IS ALMOST OUT!

       ╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

The long awaited feature to have stable ELPA packages is now available in the
develop branch and we need to test it out before we release the 0.300 version.

The stable ELPA repository is a Git repository, the official one is called
Spacelpa and it is hosted on GitHub here:

    https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacelpa

In the end only the master branch will use the stable ELPA repository and the
develop branch will continue to use bleeding edge packages from MELPA
essentially.

Unfortunately this new feature requires at least Emacs 25.1 to work correctly as
we need the archive priority feature of package.el that shipped with this
version of Emacs.

The ELPA repository configuration is set in a new immutable file called .lock
that sits at the root of the Spacemacs git repository.

Spacemacs downloads the whole ELPA stable repository locally so it means that
once it is installed you don't need an Internet connection anymore to install
any packages covered by Spacemacs layers!

Default installation location of the ELPA stable repository is in:

    ~/.emacs.d/.cache/stable-elpa

If you want to disable the ELPA stable repository put this in your dotfile in
the user-init function:

    (setq configuration-layer-elpa-archives
          '(("melpa"    . "melpa.org/packages/")
            ("gnu"      . "elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))
