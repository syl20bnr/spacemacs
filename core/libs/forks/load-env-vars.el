;;; Commentary:

;; This package allows you set environment variables loaded from a
;; file with bash style variable declarations.
;; Supported syntax:
;;
;; export KEY=VALUE
;; KEY=VALUE
;; KEY='VALUE'
;; KEY="VALUE"
;; # Comment lines are ignored
;; KEY=VALUE # Inline comments are ignored
;; KEY: VALUE
;;
;; Updates for Spacemacs:
;; - set `exec-path' from PATH
