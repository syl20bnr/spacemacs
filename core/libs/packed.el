;;; Commentary:

;; Packed provides some package manager agnostic utilities to work
;; with Emacs Lisp packages.  As far as Packed is concerned packages
;; are collections of Emacs Lisp libraries that are stored in a
;; dedicated directory such as a Git repository.  And libraries are
;; Emacs Lisp files that provide the correct feature (matching the
;; filename).

;; Where a package manager might depend on metadata, Packed instead
;; uses some heuristics to get the same information â€” that is slower
;; and might also fail at times but makes it unnecessary to maintain
;; package recipes.
