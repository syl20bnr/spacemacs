;;; Commentary:

;; This file allows a curator to publish an archive of Emacs packages.

;; The archive is generated from a set of recipes, which describe elisp
;; projects and repositories from which to get them.  The term "package"
;; here is used to mean a specific version of a project that is prepared
;; for download and installation.

RCP is the package recipe as an object.  If the `files' slot of

If optional ASSERT is non-nil, then raise an error if nil would

`files' results in the same set of files as the default spec,
then show a warning.

A files specification is a list.  Its elements are processed in
order and can have the following form:

- :defaults

  If the first element is `:defaults', then that means to prepend
  the default files spec to the SPEC specified by the remaining
  elements.

- GLOB

  A string is glob-expanded to match zero or more files.  Matched
  files are copied to the top-level directory.

- (SUBDIRECTORY GLOB...)

  A list that begins with a string causes the files matched by
  the second and subsequent elements to be copied into the sub-
  directory specified by the first element.

- (:exclude GLOB...)

  A list that begins with `:exclude' causes files that were
  matched by earlier elements that are also matched by the second
