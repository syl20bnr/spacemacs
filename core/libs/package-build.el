;;; Commentary:

;; This file allows a curator to publish an archive of Emacs packages.

;; The archive is generated from a set of recipes which describe elisp
;; projects and repositories from which to get them.  The term
;; "package" here is used to mean a specific version of a project that
;; is prepared for download and installation.
