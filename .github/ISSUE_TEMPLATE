If you are posting about a *bug* please close this issue and open a new one from within Spacemacs using:
- `SPC h I`

(I = capital i)

If the bug makes Spacemacs unusable, you can find the bug report template [here](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/core/templates/REPORTING.template).

A few optional steps that might help:
- Update `emacs` to latest stable release.
- [Update](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs#update) `spacemacs`.
- Update all emacs packages. 
  -`M-x configuration-layer/update-packages`. When seeing the prompt, type `y` and then restart emacs with `SPC q r`.
- ~~If you are on Windows, try to restart.~~
