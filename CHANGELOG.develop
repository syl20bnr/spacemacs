#+END_EXAMPLE

* Release 0.300.x
** 0.300.0
*** Hot new feature
- Extensive use of lazy loading of packages and other tricks to reduce Spacemacs
  startup time. In most cases you should see a noticable improvement in load time
  and smoothness in startup. We also added the time spent to load your personal
  =dotspacemacs/user-config= so you can quickly spot if it is a bottleneck
  (thanks to Sylvain Benner, Ben Leggett, and bmag)
- Added support for native line numbers in Emacs 26+ (thanks to bmag)
- Improved themes support. Support are now handled like regular packages. The
  list of themes now supports =:location= keyword like in package lists. More
  information in the =Themes= section of the documentation.
- Added environment-variable caching. At startup, if the cache does not exist,
  Spacemacs loads environment variables using =exec-path-from-shell= and writes
  the cache to be used on next startup. Please read carefully the new
  documentation section =Environment variables and PATH= in =DOCUMENTATION.org=
  (thanks to Sylvain Benner, Codruț Constantin Gușoi, and Paolo G. Giarrusso)
- Improved support of custom settings file. All custom settings are now
  encapsulated in a function called =dotspacemacs/emacs-custom-settings= in the
  dotfile if the user does not specify a custom location for the custom settings
  file by modifying the variable =custom-file=. This allows Spacemacs to
  correctly loads custom settings at the end of the loading process, fixing
  unwanted overriden custom settings by layers. See section =Custom variables=
  in =DOCUMENTATION.org=.
- Introduction of =spacemacs-purpose= layer that assigns newly created buffers
  to windows based on their inferred purpose (=edit=, =help=, =chat=, =mail=,
  etc.).  See [[https://github.com/bmag/emacs-purpose][emacs-purpose]] repository for more info (thanks to bmag)
- New distribution =spacemacs-docker= used to build the official docker image
  for the Spacemacs container (thanks to Eugene Yaremenko)
- Added support for =ripgrep=. To enable it add =rg= to
  =dotspacemacs-search-tools=. =ripgrep= key bindings are under ~SPC s r~
  prefix. (thanks to Aron Griffis)
- Simplify declaration of company backends, see the section
  =Add auto-completion in a layer= of the =README.org= file of the
  =auto-completion= layer.
- Added experimental support for the emacs portable dumper; see
  =EXPERIMENTAL.org=. This allows for instant Spacemacs startup time with
  pre-loaded heavy packages like =Org= and =Helm=
  (thanks to Sylvain Benner, Compro Prasad and Keith Simmons)
*** Breaking Changes
**** Major
- Support for Emacs 24 has been dropped, the minimal Emacs version is now
  =25.1=.
**** Core
- Change loading order of layers init functions. Previously the =pre-init=,
  =init= and =post-init= function were called in a row for each package. Now
  /all/ =pre-init= functions are called for all packages, then /all/ =init=
  functions of all packages are called, finally /all/ =post-init= functions of
  all packages are called. It might require some updates of your private layers.
- All custom settings are now encapsulated in a function called
  =dotspacemacs/emacs-custom-settings= which is managed by Spacemacs and written
  to your dotfile. This allows Spacemacs to control when those settings are
  applied. While it should not break your custom settings you should check that
  they are all applied correctly once you reboot Emacs. Also you may have to
  clean up your dotfile if some custom settings are still present in your
  dotfile outside of the function =dotspacemacs/emacs-custom-settings=.
- Company backends declaration has been revamped to be less verbose and easier
  to use. For more info see the section =Add auto-completion in a layer= of
  the README.org file of the =auto-completion= layer, also you can read [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/commit/74fdbb6][commit
  message of commit 74fdbb6]].
- The function =add-flycheck-hook= has been renamed to =enable-flycheck=.
- The property =:powerline-scale= of variable =dotspacemacs-default-font= has
  been removed and replaced by the property =:separator-scale= used in the new
  dotfile variable =dotspacemacs-mode-line-theme=.
**** Layers
***** Spacemacs distribution layers
- Key bindings:
  - Changed ~SPC b B~ to ~SPC b I~ for =ibuffer= (thanks to Thomas de Beauchêne)
  - Changed ~SPC B b~ to ~SPC b B~ for non restricted buffer list
    (thanks to Thomas de Beauchêne)

    buffers has been moved to ~SPC b C-d~. Killing other buffers using a regular
    expression is now under ~SPC b C-D~.

    to define more key bindings to scroll.

  - New dotvariables =dotspacemacs-emacs-pdumper-executable-file=,
    =dotspacemacs-emacs-dumper-dump-file= and
    =dotspacemacs-enable-emacs-pdumper= to configure dump
    (thanks to Sylvain Benner)
  - New variable =dotspacemacs-enable-server= (thanks to Tad Fisher)
  - New variable =dotspacemacs-frame-title-format= which is the efault format
    string for a frame title bar, see docstring of function
    =spacemacs/frame-title-prepare= for more info (thanks to Uri Sharf and Kepi)
  - New variable =dotspacemacs-gc-cons= (thanks to Sylvain Benner)
  - New variables =dotspacemacs-import-env-vars-from-shell= and
    =dotspacemacs-import-env-vars-shell-file-name= to asynchronously import
    environment variables (thanks to Sylvain Benner)
  - New variable =dotspacemacs-initial-scratch-message= for the initial message
    in the scratch buffer (thanks to Carl Lange)
  - New variable =dotspacemacs-mode-line-themes= adds support for mode-line
    themes. Supported themes are =spacemacs=, =all-the-icons=, =vim-powerline=,
    =custom=, and =vanilla=. The first three are spaceline themes, =custom= is
    user defined, and =vanilla= is the default Emacs mode-line.
    (thanks to Sylvain Benner and James Wang)
  - New variable =dotspacemacs-server-socket-dir= for setting the server socker
    location (thanks to Carl Lange)
  - New variable =dotspacemacs-switch-to-buffer-prefers-purpose= which controls
    where =switch-to-buffer= displays the buffer. If nil, =switch-to-buffer=
    displays the buffer in the current window even if another same-purpose
    window is available. If non nil, =switch-to-buffer= displays the buffer in a
    same-purpose window even if the buffer can be displayed in the current
    window. (thanks to bmag)
  - New variable =dotspacemacs-use-spacelpa= (thanks to Sylvain Benner)
  - New variable =dotspacemacs-zone-out-when-idle= to zone when idle. Zoning
    will obfuscate the current buffer acting like a screen saver.
    (thanks to Eugene Yaremenko and Sylvain Benner)
  - New variable =dotspacemacs-undecorated-at-startup= (thanks to bb2020)

      =hybrid-style-enable-evilified-state=
    - =hybrid-mode-enable-hjkl-bindings= to =hybrid-style-enable-hjkl-bindings=
    - =hybrid-mode-use-evil-search-module= to
      =hybrid-style-use-evil-search-module=
    - =hybrid-mode-default-state= to =hybrid-style-default-state=
  - Renamed =helm= variables and made them layer variables; the old dotfile
    variables are still recognized but deprecated
    (thanks to Sylvain Benner and Kalle Lindqvist):
    - =dotspacemacs-helm-resize= to =helm-enable-auto-resize=, in the
      =spacemacs-completion= layer
    - =dotspacemacs-helm-no-header= to =helm-no-header=, in the =helm= layer
    - =dotspacemacs-helm-position= to =helm-position=, in the =helm= layer
