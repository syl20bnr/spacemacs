* Release 0.300.x
** 0.300.0
*** Hot new feature
- Add support for Android emacs.
- Extensive use of lazy loading of packages and other tricks to reduce Spacemacs
  startup time. In most cases you should see a noticable improvement in load
  time and smoothness in startup. We also added the time spent to load your
  personal =dotspacemacs/user-config= so you can quickly spot if it is a
  bottleneck (thanks to Sylvain Benner, Ben Leggett, and bmag)
- Added support for native line numbers in Emacs 26+ (thanks to bmag)
- Improved themes support. Support are now handled like regular packages. The
  list of themes now supports =:location= keyword like in package lists. More
  information in the =Themes= section of the documentation.
- Added environment-variable caching. At startup, if the cache does not exist,
  Spacemacs loads environment variables and writes the cache to be used on next
  startup. Please read carefully the new documentation section =Environment
  variables and PATH= in =DOCUMENTATION.org= (thanks to Sylvain Benner,
  Codruț Constantin Gușoi, fiveNinePlusR, Paolo G. Giarrusso,
  and Miciah Dashiel Butler Masters)
- Improved support of custom settings file. All custom settings are now
  encapsulated in a function called =dotspacemacs/emacs-custom-settings= in the
  dotfile if the user does not specify a custom location for the custom settings
  file by modifying the variable =custom-file=. This allows Spacemacs to
  correctly loads custom settings at the end of the loading process, fixing
  unwanted overriden custom settings by layers. See section =Custom variables=
  in =DOCUMENTATION.org=.
- Introduction of =spacemacs-purpose= layer that assigns newly created buffers
  to windows based on their inferred purpose (=edit=, =help=, =chat=, =mail=,
  etc.).  See [[https://github.com/bmag/emacs-purpose][emacs-purpose]] repository for more info (thanks to bmag)
- New distribution =spacemacs-docker= used to build the official docker image
  for the Spacemacs container (thanks to Eugene Yaremenko)
- Added support for =ripgrep=. To enable it add =rg= to
  =dotspacemacs-search-tools=. =ripgrep= key bindings are under ~SPC s r~
  prefix. (thanks to Aron Griffis)
- Make =ripgrep= work properly with =ripgrep config files=
  (thanks to Jacek Swierk)
- Simplify declaration of company backends, see the section
  =Add auto-completion in a layer= of the =README.org= file of the
  =auto-completion= layer.
- Added experimental support for the emacs portable dumper; see
  =EXPERIMENTAL.org=. This allows for instant Spacemacs startup time with
  pre-loaded heavy packages like =Org= and =Helm=
  (thanks to Sylvain Benner, Compro Prasad and Keith Simmons)
- Added support for native fill column indicator in Emacs 27+ (thanks to
  Andriy Kmit)
- Add support for background transparency aka true transparency. Key bindings are under ~SPC T B~ (thanks to JoshTRN)
*** Breaking Changes
**** Major
- Support for Emacs 25 or Emacs 26 has been dropped, the minimal Emacs version
  is now =27.1=.
**** Core
- Change loading order of layers init functions. Previously the =pre-init=,
  =init= and =post-init= function were called in a row for each package. Now
  /all/ =pre-init= functions are called for all packages, then /all/ =init=
  functions of all packages are called, finally /all/ =post-init= functions of
  all packages are called. It might require some updates of your private layers.
- All custom settings are now encapsulated in a function called
  =dotspacemacs/emacs-custom-settings= which is managed by Spacemacs and written
  to your dotfile. This allows Spacemacs to control when those settings are
  applied. While it should not break your custom settings you should check that
  they are all applied correctly once you reboot Emacs. Also you may have to
  clean up your dotfile if some custom settings are still present in your
  dotfile outside of the function =dotspacemacs/emacs-custom-settings=.
- Company backends declaration has been revamped to be less verbose and easier
  to use. For more info see the section =Add auto-completion in a layer= of
  the README.org file of the =auto-completion= layer, also you can read [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/commit/74fdbb6][commit
  message of commit 74fdbb6]].
- The function =add-flycheck-hook= has been renamed to =enable-flycheck=.
- The property =:powerline-scale= of variable =dotspacemacs-default-font= has
  been removed and replaced by the property =:separator-scale= used in the new
  dotfile variable =dotspacemacs-mode-line-theme=.
- Fix issue where clicking on the recent files list in the Spacemacs buffer would
  produce a type error.
