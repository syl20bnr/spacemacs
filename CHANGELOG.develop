This file containes the change log for the next major version of Spacemacs.

* Release 0.300.x
** 0.300.0
*** Breaking Changes
**** Major
- Support for Emacs 24 has been dropped, the minimal Emacs version is now
  =25.1=.
**** Key bindings
- ~SPC q z~ is noe ~SPC q f~ to kill a frame.
- ~SPC b m~ now opens the =*Messages*= buffer. The old ~SPC b m~ to kill other
  buffers has been moved to ~SPC b C-d~. Killing other buffers using a regular
  expression is now under ~SPC b C-D~.
- Scrolling key bindings are now under ~SPC N~ instead of ~SPC n~.
- Key binding ~SPC e e~ is now for triggering a syntax check, the old action
  (explain error around point) has been moved to ~SPC e x~.

**** Python
- Key bindings (thanks to Danny Freeman):

  - Chaged ~SPC m s f~ to ~SPC m e f~ for =lisp-eval-defun=
  - Chaged ~SPC m s F~ to ~SPC m e F~ for =lisp-eval-defun-and-go=

**** Ruby

**** Ruby on Rails
- Key bindings:
  - New ~SPC m r f S~ to find serializer (thanks to Boris Buliga)
**** Syntax checking
- Key bindings (thanks to Loris Lucido):
  - Changed ~SPC e e~ to ~SPC e b~ for =flycheck-buffer=
**** Others
- All custom settings are now encapsulated in a function called
  =dotspacemacs/emacs-custom-settings=. While it should not break your custom
  settings you should check that they are all applied correctly once you reboot
  Emacs. Also you may have to clean up your dotfile if some custom settings are
  still present in your dotfile outside of the function
  =dotspacemacs/emacs-custom-settings=.
- Company backends declaration has been revamped to be less verbose and easier
  to use. For more info see the section =Add auto-completion in a layer= of the
  README.org file of the =auto-completion= layer, also you can read
  [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/commit/74fdbb6][commit message of commit 74fdbb6]].
- The function =add-flycheck-hook= has been renamed to =enable-flycheck=.
- =shaders= layer has been moved to =gpu= layer.
*** Hot new feature
- Improve themes support. Support are now handled like regular packages. The
  list of themes now supports =:location= keyword like in layer list. More
  information in the =Themes= section of the documentation.
- Introduction of =spacemacs-purpose= layer in charge of handling Emacs windows
  assignation for actions opening new buffers. This layer brings more
  consistency to windows creation by giving them a purpose (i.e. =edit=,
  =help=, etc...). See [[https://github.com/bmag/emacs-purpose][emacs-purpose]] repository for more info. (thanks to bmag)
- New distribution =spacemacs-docker= used to build the official docker image
  for the Spacemacs container (thanks to Eugene Yaremenko)
- Add support for =ripgrep=. To enable it add =rg= to
  =dotspacemacs-search-tools=. =ripgrep= key bindings are under ~SPC s r~
  prefix. (Aron Griffis)
- Improve support of custom settings file. All custom settings are now
  encapsulated in a function called =dotspacemacs/emacs-custom-settings= in the
  dotfile if the user does not specify a custom location for the custom settings
  file by modifying the variable =custom-file=. This allows Spacemacs to
  correctly loads custom settings at the end of the loading process, fixing
  unwanted overriden custom settings by layers. See section =Custom variables=
  in =DOCUMENTATION.org=.
- Simplify declaration of company backends, see the section
  =Add auto-completion in a layer= of the =README.org= file of the
  =auto-completion= layer.

*** Removed layers
- =extra-langs= (replaced by ad-hoc layers)
*** Dotfile changes
- Variables:
  - New variable =dotspacemacs-switch-to-buffer-prefers-purpose= which
    controls where =switch-to-buffer= displays the buffer. If nil,
    =switch-to-buffer= displays the buffer in the current window even if another
    same-purpose window is available. If non nil, =switch-to-buffer= displays
    the buffer in a same-purpose window even if the buffer can be displayed in
    the current window. (thanks to bmag)
  - New variable =dotspacemacs-zone-out-when-idle= to zone when idle. Zoning will
    obfuscate the current buffer acting like a screen saver. (thanks to Eugene
    Yaremenko)
  - New variable =dotspacemacs-frame-title-format= which is the efault format
    string for a frame title bar, see docstring of function
    =spacemacs/frame-title-prepare= for more info (thanks to Uri Sharf and Kepi)
  - New variable =dotspacemacs-mode-line-themes= adds support for mode-line themes.
    Supported themes are =spacemacs=, =all-the-icons=, =vim-powerline=, =custom=,
    and =vanilla=. The first three are spaceline themes, =custom= is user defined,
    and =vanilla= is the default Emacs mode-line. (thanks to Sylvain Benner)
- Can use the univeral prefix argument to open both the =*scratch*= buffer and
  the =*Messages*= buffer in another window (thanks to Thomas de Beauchêne)
