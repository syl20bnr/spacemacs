# Auctex Layer

Includes support for Auctex including some bindings, sane defaults, and manual loading for better startup times.

## Manual Loading

In order to load AucTex properly you must use `SPC e l` before opening any TeX files.

## Company Auctex

Along with other things this layer includes company-auctex, it's only enabled if you also enable my other contrib layer `company-mode`.

## Other Things

This layer binds the key `SPC m b` (and `H-r`) to save the current file, build it and view in your default viewer.
It also binds `me` and `mc` to create and close environments.

## Maintainer

This layer was created by and is maintained by @trishume, ping me in the Gitter chat if you have questions. Feel free to submit
PRs for this layer though if you have improvements.
