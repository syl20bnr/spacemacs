# Auctex Layer

Includes support for Auctex including some bindings, sane defaults, and manual loading for better startup times.

## Company Auctex

Along with other things this layer includes company-auctex, it's only enabled if you also enable my other contrib layer `company-mode`.

Tags navigation can be performed with key `%` thanks to [evil-matchit][].
