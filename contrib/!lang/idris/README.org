* Description

  This layer adds support for [[http://idris-lang.org/][Idris]] language.

** Features
- highlighting, completion, repl and compiler integration via [[https://github.com/idris-hackers/idris-mode][idris-mode]].
- :apropos and documentation support via [[https://github.com/david-christiansen/helm-idris][helm-idris]].

 *This layer is in construction, it needs your contribution and bug reports.*


* Install

** Layer
To use this contribution add it to your =~/.spacemacs=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-list
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(idris))
#+END_SRC

* Idris
This layer basically requires you have idris installed and available in your path.

Usually this means you have installed idris via cabal and have the binary available
in your path.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
export PATH=~/.cabal/bin/:$PATH
#+END_SRC

_or_ to the Emacs =exec-path= variable in the =dotspacemacs/init= function of
your =.spacemacs= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'exec-path "~/.cabal/bin/")
#+END_SRC

*Note:* it is important to add the path in the =dotspacemacs/init= function,
so that the path is added before any layers is loaded.


** OS X

Note that =emacs.app= for OS X does not pick up =$PATH= from =~/.bashrc= or
=~/.zshrc= when launched from outside a terminal.

* Key bindings

All Idris specific bindings are prefixed with the major-mode leader
~SPC m~.

Top-level commands are prefixed by ~SPC m~:

| Key Binding | Description             |
|-------------+-------------------------|
| ~SPC m r~   | load file onto the repl |
| ~SPC m t~   | describe type at point  |
| ~SPC m d~   | add clause              |
| ~SPC m l~   | make lemma              |
| ~SPC m c~   | case split              |
| ~SPC m w~   | make with block         |
| ~SPC m m~   | add missing             |
| ~SPC m p~   | 'idris-proof-search     |
| ~SPC m h~   | 'idris-docs-at-point    |
