* Description

This layer adds support for working with Vagrant using [[https://github.com/ottbot/vagrant.el][vagrant.el]] and
[[https://github.com/dougm/vagrant-tramp][vagrant-tramp]].

** Features:
 - Manage boxes (under the ~SPC V~ prefix)
 - Remote editing on Vagrant boxes via Tramp

* Install

** Layer

To use this contribution add it to your =~/.spacemacs=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(ruby vagrant))
#+END_SRC

*Note:* Since vagrant files are written in =ruby= it is recommended
to install the =ruby= layer as well.

** Vagrant

Follow the [[http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html][Installing Vagrant]] and [[http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html][Getting Started]] guides in
Vagrant's documentation.

** Testing

If you'd like to test this layer out in a simple way (for example to
make sure you have Vagrant configured correctly) there is a [[file:Vagrantfile][Vagrantfile]]
in this directory.
