* Description
*This layer works only on OS X for the moment*

[[http://kapeli.com/dash][dash]] is a great tool for quick access to various sets of documentation.

[[https://github.com/stanaka/dash-at-point][dash-at-point]] is the package used to integrate =dash= in Emacs. It will try
to intelligently guess specific docsets to use based off of your current mode.

* Install

To use this contribution add it to your =~/.spacemacs=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(dash))
#+END_SRC

** Dash

You have to install [[http://kapeli.com/dash][dash]] on your machine.

It is recommended to set the =HUD mode= in your Dash application preferences
when using this layer. 

See the documentation [[https://github.com/stanaka/dash-at-point#Usage][dash-at-point-usage]] for more information
on customizing specific docsets for modes.

* Key bindings

| Key Binding | Description                                             |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC d d~   | Lookup thing at point in Dash                           |
| ~SPC d D~   | Lookup thing at point in Dash within a specified Docset |

** helm-dash
dash-at-point is linked to the GUI app and is only available for OSX. On linux, 
[[https://github.com/areina/helm-dash][helm-dash]] is used instead. It requires no app.
You can use =dash/helm-dash-docset-newpath= to set the location path of your docsets.

* TODOs

** TODO Check zeal
[[http://zealdocs.org/][zeal]] is an open source alternative to dash with Emacs integration available.
