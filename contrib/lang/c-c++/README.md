## Description

This layer adds configuration for C/C++ language as well support for [CMake][]
scripts.

## Features

- Support syntax checking with Clang.
- Display function or variable definition at the bottom. (when `semantic` layer is included)
- Display current function cursor is in at the top. See [this page][stickyfunc-demos]
for demos in some programming languages. (when `semantic` layer is included)
- Support common refactoring with [semantic-refactor][]. See [this page][srefactor-demos]
for demonstration of refactoring features. (when `semantic` layer is included)

### Clang Fanciness

This layer adds some fancy improvements to `company-clang`.
It includes a hook to load a projects `.clang_complete` file, which is
just a text file with one clang flag per line, a format also used by
other text editor clang plugins.

Not only does this allow proper autocomplete on projects with extra
includes and flags, but there is also support for flycheck so that it
doesn't complain about missing header files.
