* Description

Spacemacs is not just emacs+vim. It can have OSX keybindings too! 
This layer globally defines common OSX keybindings. ~⌘~ is set to
~super~ and ~⌥~ is set to ~meta~. Aside from that, there's nothing
much, really.

While in =dired= this layer will try to use =gls= instead of =ls=.

* Philosophy

While this layer enables common OSX bindings, it does not implement
OSX navigation keybindings. Spacemacs is meant to be used with evil,
and we encourage you to do so :)

* Install

** Layer

To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(osx))
#+END_SRC

*** Use with non-US keyboard layouts

If you need the ~⌥~ key to type common characters such as `{[]}~` which is usual
for e.g. Finnish and Swedish keyboard layouts, you'll probably want to leave the
~⌥~ key unchanged by setting the =osx-use-option-as-meta= variable to =nil=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
     (osx :variables osx-use-option-as-meta nil)))
#+END_SRC

** Coreutils

To get =gls= install coreutils homebrew:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install coreutils
#+END_SRC

* Key Bindings

| Key Binding | Description       |
|-------------+-------------------|
| ~⌘ +~       | Scale up text     |
| ~⌘ -~       | Scale down text   |
| ~⌘ q~       | Quit              |
| ~⌘ v~       | Paste             |
| ~⌘ c~       | Copy              |
| ~⌘ x~       | Cut               |
| ~⌘ a~       | Select all        |
| ~⌘ w~       | Close window      |
| ~⌘ W~       | Close frame       |
| ~⌘ n~       | New frame         |
| ~⌘ z~       | Undo              |
| ~⌘ Z~       | Redo              |
| ~⌃ ⌘ f~     | Toggle fullscreen |

* Future Work

- Allow user to choose from either ~hyper~ or ~super~ as ~⌘~. This is an option
  that is supported cross-platform.
- Configurable option to keep the OSX and spacemacs clipboards separate
