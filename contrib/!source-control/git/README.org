* Install

** Layer

To use this contribution add it to your =~/.spacemacs=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(git))
#+END_SRC

** Magit status fullscreen

To display the =magit status= buffer in fullscreen set the variable
=git-magit-status-fullscreen= to =t= in your =dotspacemacs/init= function.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun dotspacemacs/init ()
    (setq-default git-magit-status-fullscreen t)
  )
#+END_SRC

** Magit auto-complete

Magit auto-complete feature is enabled. For this feature to work best you
have to setup your Git repository directory in your =dotspacemacs/config=
function, this is the folder where you keep all your git-controlled projects
(the path should end up with a ~=/~= to respect Emacs conventions):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq magit-repository-directories '("~/repos/"))
#+END_SRC

For more information, see [[https://magit.github.io/master/magit.html#Status][Magit-User-Manual#Status]]

** Magit SVN plugin

For convenience the magit SVN plugin can be activated directly in the Git
layer by setting the variable =git-enable-magit-svn-plugin= to =t=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun dotspacemacs/init ()
    (setq-default git-enable-magit-svn-plugin t)
  )
#+END_SRC

** Git

Of course if your OS does not ship with git (!) you'll have to install it
on your machine. You can download it from the [[http://git-scm.com/downloads][download page]].

* Working with Git

** Magit

=Spacemacs= uses [[http://magit.github.io/][magit]] to manage Git repositories.

To open a =status buffer=, type in a buffer of a Git repository: ~SPC g s~

~hjkl~ navigation is enabled in all Magit buffers. The default Magit keys
on ~hjkl~ (if they exist) are remapped on ~HJKL~.

Here are the often used bindings inside a =status buffer=, please note that
the following key bindings are valid in Vim editing style, in Emacs editing
style you can refer directly to the magit manual:

** Quick guide for recurring use cases in Magit

- Amend a commit:
  - ~L l~ to open =log buffer=
  - ~c a~ on the commit you want to amend
  - ~C-c C-c~ to submit the changes
- Squash last commit:
  - ~L l~ to open =log buffer=
  - ~r e~ on the second to last commit, it opens the =rebase buffer=
  - ~j~ to put point on last commit
  - ~s~ to squash it
  - ~C-c C-c~ to continue to the =commit message buffer=
  - ~C-c C-c~ again when you have finished to edit the commit message
- Force push a squashed commit:
  - in the =status buffer= you should see the new commit unpushed and the old
    commit unpulled
  - ~P -f P~ for force a push (*beware* usually it is not recommended to rewrite
    the history of a public repository, but if you are *sure* that you are the
    only one to work on a repository it is ok - i.e. in your fork).
- Add upstream remote (the parent repository you have forked):
  - ~M~ to open the =remote popup=
  - ~a~ to add a remote, type the name (i.e. =upstream=) and the URL
- Pull changes from upstream (the parent repository you have forked) and push:
  - ~F -r C-u F~ and choose =upstream= or the name you gave to it
  - ~P P~ to push the commit to =origin=

** Git time machine

[[https://github.com/pidu/git-timemachine][git-timemachine]] allows to quickly browse the commits of the current buffer.

| Key Binding | Description                                    |
|-------------+------------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC g t~   | start git timemachine and initiate micro-state |
| ~c~         | show current commit                            |
| ~n~         | show next commit                               |
| ~N~         | show previous commit                           |
| ~p~         | show previous commit                           |
| ~q~         | leave micro-state and git timemachine          |
| ~Y~         | copy current commit hash                       |
