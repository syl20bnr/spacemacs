# Tristan Hume's Contrib Layer

Mostly consists of support for additional languages including:
LaTeX, Idris, OpenSCAD, Julia, Arduino, QML, Lua

Also adds smooth scrolling and Helm Ag support.

## Company Auctex

Along with other things this layer includes company-auctex, it's only enabled if you also enable my other contrib layer `company-mode`.
