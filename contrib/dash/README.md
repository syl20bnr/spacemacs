**This layer works only on OS X for the moment**

## Description

[dash][] is a great tool for quick access to various sets of documentation.

[dash-at-point][] is the package used to integrate `dash` in Emacs. It will try
to intelligently guess specific docsets to use based off of your current mode.

## Install

To use this contribution add it to your `~/.spacemacs`

```elisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(dash))
```

### Dash

You have to install [dash][] on your machine.

It is recommended to set the `HUD mode` in your Dash application preferences
when using this layer. 

See the documentation [dash-at-point][dash-at-point-usage] for more information
on customizing specific docsets for modes.

## Key bindings

    Key Binding     |                 Description
--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------
<kbd>SPC d d</kbd>  | Lookup thing at point in Dash
<kbd>SPC d D</kbd>  | Lookup thing at point in Dash within a specified Docset

## TODO

### Check zeal

[zeal][] is an open source alternative to dash with Emacs integration available.

### Check helm-dash

dash-at-point is linked to the GUI app and is only available for OSX. Another
project, [helm-dash](https://github.com/areina/helm-dash) is in the works.
It appears to currently only be available for linux though, but working towards
mac and windows support. It would be great to supplement or even replace
dash-at-point considering that it doesn't require paying for the app, and
integrates with helm.
