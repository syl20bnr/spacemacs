#+TITLE: Location contribution layer for Spacemacs

* Table of Contents
 
* Description
This layer offers few location sensetive adjustment to Emacs, such as
automaticly switching between light (day) and dark (night) themes, weather
forecast and on OS X, also automatic tracking of location, using OS X's
CoreLocation services.

** Supported packages in this layer

- [[https://github.com/hadronzoo/theme-changer][theme-changer]]
- [[https://github.com/aaronbieber/sunshine.el/blob/master/sunshine.el][sunshine]]
- [[https://github.com/purcell/osx-location][osx-location]]

* Install

To enable this contribution layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=~ like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(location))
#+END_SRC

All services are disable by default. To enable all, or some of them, add instead
something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (location :variables
            enable-osx-location-service-support t
            enable-weather-forecast t
            enable-automatic-theme-managment t)
#+END_SRC

To set location manually, add something like this inside the ~dotspacemacs/config
defun~. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq calendar-location-name "Barcelona, Spain"
        calendar-latitude 41.23
        calendar-longitude 1.80)
#+END_SRC

On OS X, all of these variables get setup automatically by the ~osx-location~
service, when enabled. If ~calendar-location-name~ was ommitted, it'll be
stringed-up like so: "41.23, 1.80".

* Key Bindings
New keybindings for this layer are for using ~sunshine~.

| Evil      | Holy | Command                                       |
|-----------+------+-----------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC a w~ |      | Display pretty weather forecast               |
| ~SPC a W~ |      | Display quick weather forecast in mini buffer |

* Customize it!
** theme-changer
Theme changer will switch between two given themes, depending on time at
geographical location. By default, it will use first two themes the user has setup in
~dotemacs-themes~. 

If the list is empty, for whatever reason, it'll swap ~spacemacs-light~ and
~spacemacs-dark~ by default.

** sunshine (weather forecast)
Sunshine uses the imperial unit system by default. To switch to metric, do this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq sunshine-units 'metric)
#+END_SRC

Weather forecast icons are disabled by default, but can be toggled by pressing
`i' within this mode's main buffer. To display weather forecast icons by default
("pretty mode"), change the settings to this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq sunshine-show-icons t)
#+END_SRC

** osx-location
OS X users can take adavantage of automatic geogrphical discovery using the OS'
CoreLocation system service, implemented as a long running background process. A
helper script will need to be given proper access first time this layer is
activated.
