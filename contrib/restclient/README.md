# Restclient contribution layer

## What is this?
This is a package that lets you have a REPL-like interface
for http requests. Full documentation and examples can be found in the
package's [GitHub Page](https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el).

Also there is an [Emacs Rocks!](http://emacsrocks.com/e15.html) episode of it.
