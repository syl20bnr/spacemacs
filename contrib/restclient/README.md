# Keybindings

| Evil-leader key | What it does                                |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| mc              | runs the query under the cursor, tries to pretty-print the response (if possible)               |
| mr              | same, but doesn't do anything with the response, just shows the buffer |
| mv              | same as `mc` , but doesn't switch focus to other window|
