## Description

This layer adds [emacs-ycmd][] support.

## Install

### Layer

To use this contribution add it to your `~/.spacemacs`

```elisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(ycmd))
```

### YCMD

In order to use this layer you must have a local [ycmd][] installation and must
set the `ycmd-server-command` variable to reflect the path to that installation.
See the [emacs-ycmd][] readme for more instructions on this.

### Other Requirements

This package requires the `auto-completion` layer in order to get actual
completion. The `syntax-checking` layer is required for flycheck support.

## Configuration

By default this layer only activates ycmd for `c++-mode`.

If you want ycmd suppoert in other modes you might just want to add it for
specific languages like: ```elisp (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'ycmd-mode) ```

## Key Bindings

Adds `SPC m g g` go to definition binding to `c++-mode` as well as `SPC m g G`
for the more imprecise but faster version.
