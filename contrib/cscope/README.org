* Description
This layer provides bindings for using [[http://cscope.sourceforge.net][Cscope]] and [[https://github.com/portante/pycscope][PyCscope]] in Spacemacs.

=Cscope= provides indexing and searching capabilities for C and C++ code.
=PyCscope= extends these capabilities for Python code as well. See
[[https://github.com/OpenGrok/OpenGrok/wiki/Comparison-with-Similar-Tools][here]] for a comparison between =Cscope= and other similar tools (such as gtags).

* Install
** Layer
To use this contribution add it to your =~/.spacemacs=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(cscope))
#+END_SRC

** Cscope
Install =Cscope= through your package manager, or download it from the
[[http://cscope.sourceforge.net/#downloads][website]] and build it from source.

From package manager (for example, Ubuntu):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get install cscope
#+END_SRC

From source:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
tar xvf cscope-15.8b
cd cscope-15.8b
./configure
make
sudo make install
#+END_SRC

** PyCscope
Install PyCscope through pip:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install pycscope
#+END_SRC

* Usage

Before using any helm-cscope commands, remember to create a Cscope index file.
Do it by running the command =cscope-index-files= for C and C++ projects, or the
command =cscope/run-pycscope= for Python projects, bound to ~SPC m g i~.
