## Description

This layer group together packages to work with [Evernote][].

It uses the non official Evernote command line [geeknote][] which allows
users to write notes in markdown, and sync them.

[geeknote.el][] is a wrapper for some of the most used `geeknote` commands.
By default, `geeknote.el` doesn't have key bindings defined. This
contribution layer provides key bindings for all of geeknote.el's
exposed features.

## Install

### Layer

To use this contribution add it to your `~/.spacemacs`

```elisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(evernote)
  "List of contribution to load."
)
```

### geeknote

The command `geeknote` is expected to be present in your `$PATH`. To
obtain this utility, please refer to the official geeknote
[documentation][geeknote-doc].

### geeknote.el

`geeknote.el` relies on having a correctly setup geeknote editor. To set
this up, run the following command in your terminal after successfully
installing `geeknote`:

```
$ geeknote settings --editor "emacsclient"
```

If you would prefer to customize the geeknote command to be used
such as specifying the path to the geeknote python script, please
refer to the `geeknote.el` [documentation][geeknote.el].
