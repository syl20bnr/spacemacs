* Description

This layer enhances the default commands of Emacs and is primarily intended to
be used with the =emacs= editing style as it does not change anything in the Vim
key bindings.

However the =emacs= editing style is not required, you can still use this layer
while you are using the =vim= editing style if you have some kind of mixed
style.

The commands defined in this layer are taken from various sources like [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][Prelude]].

* Install

To use this contribution add it to your =~/.spacemacs=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(better-defaults))
#+END_SRC

* Functions

** smart-move-beginning-of-line

Pressed one time, go to the first non-whitespace character of the line, pressed
