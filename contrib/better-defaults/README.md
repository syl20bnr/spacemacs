## Description

This layer enhances the default commands of Emacs and is primarily intended
to be used with the `emacs` editing style as it does not change anything
in the Vim key bindings.

However the `emacs` editing style is not required, you can still use this
layer while you are using the `vim` editing style if you have some kind of
mixed style.

The commands defined in this layer are taken from various sources like
[Prelude][].

## Install

To use this contribution add it to your `~/.spacemacs`

```elisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(better-defaults))
```

## Functions

### smart-move-beginning-of-line

Pressed one time, go to the first non-whitespace character of the line,
pressed again, go to the beginning of the line.
