* Install
** Layer
To use this contribution add it to your =~/.spacemacs=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(chinese))
#+END_SRC
** Configuration
*** Configure the Default Input Method
The default Chinese input method is =Chinese-pyim=, if you are a Wubi(五笔) user, 
you could set the variable `chinese-enable-wubi` to t:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
    (chinese :variables chinese-im-enable-wubi t)))
#+end_src
*** Configure the =Chinese-pyim= Input Method
When the first time you use =Chinese-pyim=, you should install the lexicon(词库) file.
You could call =pyim-dicts-manager= to open up the settings buffer and press =i e= to install the default lexicon.
The lexicon is about 20M, so you should be patient when downloading starts.
After the lexicon file is downloaded, just press =s= to save and =R= to restart configuration.
