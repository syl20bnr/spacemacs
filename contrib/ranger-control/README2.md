# Ranger Control

This module hooks into the command server in MacRanger to add the command `<SPC> p d`
which adds a special `e` tab in ranger that is in the current projectile directory.

Currently this functionality only works with MacRanger but I plan on making it a plugin
that anyone can install into their ranger.
