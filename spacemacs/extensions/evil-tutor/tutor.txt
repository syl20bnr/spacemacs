     TL;DR: press C-j (CTRL+j) to jump right to the first lesson. The
     tutorial takes approximately 30 minutes.

     At any moment if you feel stuck, you can switch to emacs state with:
     
           M-x evil-emacs-state RET

     Then continue the tutorial by going back to the normal state with:

           M-x evil-normal-state RET

                                     * * *

     Evil is a very powerful emulation of Vim that has many commands,
     too many to explain in a tutor such as this. This tutor is designed
     to describe enough of the commands that you will be able to easily use
     Emacs powered with Evil as an all-purpose editor.

     The approximate time required to complete the tutor is 25-30 minutes,
     depending upon how much time is spent with experimentation.

     The commands in the lessons will modify the text. Make a copy of this
     file to practise on (if you started "evil-tutor-mode" this is already a
     copy).

     It is important to remember that this tutor is set up to teach by
     use. That means that you need to execute the commands to learn them
     properly. If you only read the text, you will forget the commands!

     Now, make sure that your Shift-Lock key is NOT depressed and press
     the j key enough times to move the cursor so that Lesson 1.1 completely
     fills the screen.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                        Lesson 1.1:  MOVING THE CURSOR


   ** To move the cursor, press the h,j,k,l keys as indicated. **
             ^
             k              Hint:  The h key is at the left and moves left.
       < h       l >               The l key is at the right and moves right.
             j                     The j key looks like a down arrow
             v
  1. Move the cursor around the screen until you are comfortable.

  2. Hold down the down key (j) until it repeats.
---> Now you know how to move to the next lesson

  3. Using the down key, move to Lesson 1.2.

Note: If you are ever unsure about something you typed, press <ESC> to place
      you in normal state. Then retype the command you wanted.

Note: The cursor keys should also work. But using hjkl you will be able to
      move around much faster, once you get used to it.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                     Lesson 1.2: ENTERING AND EXITING EMACS


  !! NOTE: Before executing any of the steps below, read this entire lesson!!

  1. Press the <ESC> key (to make sure you are in normal state).

  2. Type:                        :qa! <ENTER>.

---> This exits the editor WITHOUT saving any changes you have made.
     If you want to save the changes and exit type:
                                  :wqa  <ENTER>

  3. When you see the shell prompt, return in Emacs and resume your tutorial
     session by typing:
                                  M-x evil-tutor-start

  4. If you have these steps memorized and are confident, execute steps
     1 through 3 to exit and re-enter the editor. Then move the cursor down
     to Lesson 1.3.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                     Lesson 1.3: TEXT EDITING - DELETION


** While in normal state press  x  to delete the character under the cursor. **

  1. Move the cursor to the line below marked --->.

  2. To fix the errors, move the cursor until it is on top of the
     character to be deleted.

  3. Press the  x  key to delete the unwanted character.

  4. Repeat steps 2 through 4 until the sentence is correct.

---> The ccow jumpedd ovverr thhe mooon.

  5. Now that the line is correct, go on to Lesson 1.4.

NOTE: As you go through this tutor, do not try to memorize, learn by usage.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                     Lesson 1.4: TEXT EDITING - INSERTION


           ** While in normal state press  i  to insert text. **

  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.

  2. To make the first line the same as the second, move the cursor on top
     of the first character AFTER where the text is to be inserted.

  3. Press  i  and type in the necessary additions.

  4. As each error is fixed press <ESC> to return to normal state.
     Repeat steps 2 through 4 to correct the sentence.

---> There is text misng this .
---> There is some text missing from this line.

  5. When you are comfortable inserting text move to the summary below.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                               LESSON 1 SUMMARY


  1. The cursor is moved using either the arrow keys or the hjkl keys.
         h (left)        j (down)       k (up)            l (right)

  2. To exit Emacs type:  <ESC> :qa! <ENTER>  to trash all changes.
                OR type:  <ESC> :wqa <ENTER>  to save the changes.

  4. To delete a character under the cursor in normal state type:  x

  5. To insert text at the cursor while in normal state type:
         i
         type in text
         <ESC>

NOTE: Pressing <ESC> will place you in normal state or will cancel
      an unwanted and partially completed command.

Now continue with Lesson 2.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                        Lesson 2.1: DELETION COMMANDS


               ** Type  dw  to delete to the end of a word. **

  1. Press  <ESC>  to make sure you are in normal state.

  2. Move the cursor to the line below marked --->.

  3. Move the cursor to the beginning of a word that needs to be deleted.

  4. Type  dw  to make the word disappear.

  NOTE: The letters dw will appear on the last line of the screen as you type
        them. If you typed something wrong, press  <ESC>  and start over.

---> There are a some words fun that don't belong paper in this sentence.

  5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the sentence is correct and go to Lesson 2.2.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                      Lesson 2.2: MORE DELETION COMMANDS


               ** Type  d$  to delete to the end of the line. **

  1. Press  <ESC>  to make sure you are in normal state.

  2. Move the cursor to the line below marked --->.

  3. Move the cursor to the end of the correct line (AFTER the first . ).

  4. Type  d$  to delete to the end of the line.

---> Somebody typed the end of this line twice. end of this line twice.


  5. Move on to Lesson 2.3 to understand what is happening.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                     Lesson 2.3: ON COMMANDS AND OBJECTS


  The format for the  d  delete command is as follows:

         [number]  d  object    OR    d  [number]  object

  Where:
    number - is how many times to execute the command (optional, default=1).
    d - is the command to delete.
    object - is what the command will operate on (listed below).

  A short list of objects:
    w - from the cursor to the end of the word, including the space.
    e - from the cursor to the end of the word, NOT including the space.
    $ - from the cursor to the end of the line.

NOTE:  For the adventurous, pressing just the object while in normal state
       without a command will move the cursor as specified in the object list.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                Lesson 2.4: AN EXCEPTION TO  'COMMAND-OBJECT'


                   ** Type  dd   to delete a whole line. **

  Due to the frequency of whole line deletion, the designers of Evil (credits
  to designers of Vim) decided it would be easier to simply type two d's in a
  row to delete a line.

  1. Move the cursor to the second line in the phrase below.
  2. Type  dd  to delete the line.
  3. Now move to the fourth line.
  4. Type   2dd   (remember  number-command-object) to delete the two lines.

      1)  Roses are red,
      2)  Mud is fun,
      3)  Violets are blue,
      4)  I have a car,
      5)  Clocks tell time,
      6)  Sugar is sweet
      7)  And so are you.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                         Lesson 2.5: THE UNDO COMMAND


                   ** Press  u  to undo the last commands  **

  1. Move the cursor to the line below marked ---> and place it on the
     first error.
  2. Type  x  to delete the first unwanted character.
  3. Now type  u  to undo the last command executed.
  4. This time fix all the errors on the line using the  x  command.
  5. Now type  u  a few times to undo all the preceding commands.
  6. Now type CTRL-R (keeping CTRL key pressed while hitting R) a few times
     to redo the commands (undo the undo's).

---> Fiix the errors oon thhis line and reeplace them witth undo.

  8. These are very useful commands.  Now move on to the Lesson 2 Summary.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                               LESSON 2 SUMMARY


  1. To delete from the cursor to the end of a word type:  dw

  2. To delete from the cursor to the end of a line type:  d$

  3. To delete a whole line type:  dd

  4. The format for a command in normal state is:

       [number]  command  object    OR    command  [number]  object
     where:
       number - is how many times to repeat the command
       command - is what to do, such as  d  for delete
       object - is what the command should act upon, such as  w  for word,
                $  for "to the end of line", etc.

  5. To undo previous actions, type:  u
     To undo the undo's type:  CTRL-R


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                         Lesson 3.1: THE PUT COMMAND


          ** Type  p  to put the last deletion after the cursor. **

  1. Move the cursor to the first line in the set below.

  2. Type  dd  to delete the line and store it in Emacs's kill ring.

  3. Move the cursor to the line ABOVE where the deleted line should go.

  4. While in normal state, type  p  to replace the line.

  5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 to put all the lines in correct order.

     d) Can you learn too?
     b) Violets are blue,
     c) Intelligence is learned,
     a) Roses are red,


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                       Lesson 3.2: THE REPLACE COMMAND


  ** Type  r  and a character to replace the character under the cursor. **

  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.

  2. Move the cursor so that it is on top of the first error.

  3. Type  r  and then the character which should replace the error.

  4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the first line is correct.

--->  Whan this lime was tuoed in, someone presswd some wrojg keys!
--->  When this line was typed in, someone pressed some wrong keys!

  5. Now move on to Lesson 3.2.

NOTE: Remember that you should be learning by use, not memorization.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                        Lesson 3.3: THE CHANGE COMMAND


            ** To change part or all of a word, type  cw  **

  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.

  2. Place the cursor on the u in lubw.

  3. Type  cw  and the correct word (in this case, type  'ine'.)

  4. Press <ESC> and move to the next error (the first character to be changed.)

  5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the first sentence is the same as the second.

---> This lubw has a few wptfd that mrrf changing usf the change command.
---> This line has a few words that need changing using the change command.

Notice that  cw  not only replaces the word, but also places you in insert.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                       Lesson 3.4: MORE CHANGES USING c


     ** The change command is used with the same objects as delete. **

  1. The change command works in the same way as delete.  The format is:

          [number]  c  object    OR    c  [number]  object

  2. The objects are also the same, such as w (word), $ (end of line) etc...

  3. Move to the first line below marked --->.

  4. Move the cursor to the first error.

  5. Type  c$  to make the rest of the line like the second and press <ESC>.

---> The end of this line needs some help to make it like the second.
---> The end of this line needs to be corrected using the  c$  command.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                               LESSON 3 SUMMARY


  1. To replace text that has already been deleted, type  p  this puts the
     deleted text AFTER the cursor (if a line was deleted it will go on the
     line below the cursor).

  2. To replace the character under the cursor, type  r  and then the
     character which will replace the original.

  3. The change command allows you to change the specified object from the
     cursor to the end of the object.  eg. Type  cw  to change from the
     cursor to the end of the word,  c$  to change to the end of a line.

  4. The format for change is:

          [number]  c  object    OR    c  [number]  object

Now go on to the next lesson.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                     Lesson 4.1: FAST MOVE IN A BUFFER


             ** Type  gg  to go to the beginning of a buffer.
                Type  G  to move to the end of a buffer. **

  Note: Read this entire lesson before executing any of the steps!!

  1. Remember the current line number where you are for Step 4.

  2. Press  G  to move you to the bottom of the buffer.
  
  3. Press  gg  to move you to the beginning of the buffer.

  4. Type  :  and the number of the line you were on and then  <ENTER>  .This
     will return you to the line you were on before the step 2.

  5. If you feel confident to do this, execute steps 1 through 3.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                        Lesson 4.2: THE SEARCH COMMAND


     ** Type  /  followed by a phrase to search for the phrase. **

  1. In normal state type the  /  character.  Notice that it and the cursor
     appear at the bottom of the screen as with the  :  command.

  2. Now type 'errroor' <ENTER>.  This is the word you want to search for.

  3. To search for the same phrase again, simply type:  n
     To search for the same phrase in the opposite direction, type:  N

  4. If you want to search for a phrase in the backwards direction, use the
     command  ?  instead of  /

---> When the search reaches the end of the buffer it will continue at the start.

  "errroor" is not the way to spell error;  errroor is an error.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                   Lesson 4.3: MATCHING PARENTHESES SEARCH


                 ** Type  %  to find a matching ),], or } **

  1. Place the cursor on any (, [, or { in the line below marked --->.

  2. Now type the  %  character.

  3. The cursor should be on the matching parenthesis or bracket.

  4. Type  %  to move the cursor back to the first bracket (by matching).

---> This ( is a test line with ('s, ['s ] and {'s } in it. ))

Note: This is very useful in debugging a program with unmatched parentheses
      (and in elisp)!


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                      Lesson 4.4: A WAY TO CHANGE ERRORS


           ** Type  :s/old/new/g  to substitute 'new' for 'old'. **

  1. Move the cursor to the line below marked --->.

  2. Type  :s/thee/the <ENTER>
     Note that this command only changes the first occurrence on the line.

  3. Now type  :s/thee/the/g  meaning substitute globally on the line.
     This changes all occurrences on the line.

---> thee best time to see thee flowers is in thee spring.

  4. To change every occurrence of a character string between two lines,

     type  :#,#s/old/new/g  where #,# are the numbers of the two lines.

     Type  :%s/old/new/g  to change every occurrence in the whole buffer.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                               LESSON 4 SUMMARY


  1. gg  moves to the beginning of the buffer.
     G   moves to the end of the buffer.
     :   followed by a line number then  <ENTER>  moves to that line number.

  2. Typing  /  followed by a phrase searches FORWARD for the phrase.
     Typing  ?  followed by a phrase searches BACKWARD for the phrase.
     After a search type  n  to find the next occurrence in the same direction
     or  N  to search in the opposite direction.

  3. Typing  %  while the cursor is on a  (,),[,],{, or }  locates its
     matching pair.

  4. To substitute new for the first old on a line type  :s/old/new
     To substitute new for all 'old's on a line type     :s/old/new/g
     To substitute phrases between two line #'s type     :#,#s/old/new/g
     To substitute all occurrences in the file type      :%s/old/new/g
     To ask for confirmation each time add 'c'           :%s/old/new/gc


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                Lesson 5.1: HOW TO EXECUTE AN EXTERNAL COMMAND


   ** Type  :!  followed by an external command to execute that command. **

  1. Type the familiar command  :  to set the cursor at the bottom of the
     screen.  This allows you to enter a command (remember we already used
     this to go to a line number in a buffer).

  2. Now type the  !  (exclamation point) character. This allows you to
     execute any external shell command.

  3. As an example type  ls  following the  !  and then hit <ENTER>.  This
     will show you a listing of your directory, just as if you were at the
     shell prompt. Or use   :!dir  if ls doesn't work (on Windows).

---> Note:  It is possible to execute any external command this way.

---> Note:  All  :  commands must be finished by hitting <ENTER>


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                      Lesson 5.2: MORE ON WRITING FILES


        ** To save the changes made to the file, type  :w FILENAME  **

  1. Type  :!ls  or  :!dir  to get a listing of your directory.
     You already know you must hit <ENTER> after this.

  2. Choose a filename that does not exist yet, such as TEST.

  3. Now type:  :w TEST  (where TEST is the filename you chose.)

  4. This saves the whole file  under the name TEST.
     To verify this, type  :!ls  or  :!dir  again to see your directory

---> Note that if you were to exit Emacs and enter again with the filename TEST,
     the file would be an exact copy of the tutor when you saved it.

  5. Now remove the file by typing:
     on Unix:     :!rm TEST
     on Windows:  :!del TEST


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Lesson 5.3: A SELECTIVE WRITE COMMAND


           ** To save part of the file, type  :#,# w FILENAME  **

  1. Once again, type  :!ls  or  :!dir  to obtain a listing of your directory
     and choose a suitable filename such as TEST.

  2. Move the cursor to the top of this lesson by pressing  C-k  to find the
     number of that line.  REMEMBER THIS NUMBER!

  3. Now move to the bottom of the lesson by pressing  C-j  to find the
     number of that line. REMEMBER THIS LINE NUMBER ALSO!

  4. To save ONLY a section to a file, type   :#,# w TEST   where #,# are
     the two numbers you remembered (top,bottom) and TEST is your filename.

  5. Again, see that the file is there with  :!ls  or  :!dir  but DO NOT
     remove it.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                   Lesson 5.4: RETRIEVING AND MERGING FILES


         ** To insert the contents of a file, type  :r FILENAME  **

  1. Type  :!ls  or  :!dir  to make sure your TEST filename is present from
     before.

  2. Place the cursor at the top of this lesson.

NOTE: After executing Step 3 you will see Lesson 5.3. Then move DOWN to this
      lesson again.

  3. Now retrieve your TEST file using the command  :r TEST  where TEST is
     the name of the file.

NOTE:  The file you retrieve is placed starting where the cursor is located.

  4. To verify that a file was retrieved, cursor back and notice that there
     are now two copies of Lesson 5.3, the original and the file version.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                               LESSON 5 SUMMARY


  1.  :!command  executes an external command.

      Some useful examples are:
          :!ls  or  :!dir                 -  shows a directory listing.
          :!rm  or  :!del FILENAME        -  removes file FILENAME.

  2.  :w FILENAME  writes the current buffer to disk with file name FILENAME.

  3.  :#,#w FILENAME  saves the lines # through # in file FILENAME.

  4.  :r FILENAME  retrieves disk file FILENAME and inserts it into the
      current buffer following the cursor position.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                         Lesson 6.1: THE OPEN COMMAND


 ** Type  o  to open a line below the cursor and place you in insert state. **

  1. Move the cursor to the line below marked --->.

  2. Type  o  to open up a line BELOW the cursor and place you in insert state

  3. Now copy the line marked ---> and press <ESC> to exit insert state.

---> After typing  o  the cursor is placed on the open line in insert state.

  4. To open up a line ABOVE the cursor, simply type a capital  O  rather
     than a lowercase  o
     Try this on the line below.
Open up a line above this by typing  O  while the cursor is on this line.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                        Lesson 6.2: THE APPEND COMMAND


               ** Type  a  to insert text AFTER the cursor. **

  1. Move the cursor to the end of the first line below marked ---> by
     typing  $  in normal state.

  2. Type an  a  to append text AFTER the character under the cursor.
     (Uppercase  A  appends to the end of the line.)

Note: This avoids typing  i , the last character, the text to insert, <ESC>,
      cursor-right, and finally, x , just to append to the end of a line!

  3. Now complete the first line.  Note also that append is exactly the same
     as insert state, except for the location where text is inserted.

---> This line will allow you to practice
---> This line will allow you to practice appending text to the end of a line.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Lesson 6.3: ANOTHER VERSION OF REPLACE


      ** Type a capital  R  to replace more than one character. **

  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.

  2. Place the cursor at the beginning of the first word that is different
     from the second line marked ---> (the word 'last').

  3. Now type  R  and replace the remainder of the text on the first line by
     typing over the old text to make the first line the same as the second.

---> To make the first line the same as the last on this page use the keys.
---> To make the first line the same as the second, type R and the new text.

  4. Note that when you press <ESC> to exit, any unaltered text remains.

  This concludes the Evil Tutor. It was intended to give a brief overview of
  Emacs+Evil editor, just enough to allow you to use the editor fairly easily.
  It is far from complete as Evil has many many more commands.
