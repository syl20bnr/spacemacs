* SVG Library

svg-lib is an Emacs library that allows to create and display various
SVG objects, namely tags, icons, buttons, progress bars, progress pies
and dates. Each object is guaranteed to fit nicely in a text buffer
ensuring width is a multiple of character width and height a multiple
of character height.

* Installation

#+begin_src elisp
M-x package-install RET svg-lib RET
#+end_src

* Quick start

For the impatient, evaluate the following expression:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-: (insert-image (svg-lib-tag "TODO"))
#+end_src

This should insert a SVG tag displaying "TODO" in a rounded box whose
size is exactly 5 characters wide (because of padding).

* Usage

** Objects

- =svg-lib-tag LABEL=
- =svg-lib-icon ICON=
- =svg-lib-icon+tag ICON LABEL=
- =svg-lib-button LABEL HOOK=
- =svg-lib-progress-bar VALUE=
- =svg-lib-progress-pie VALUE=
- =svg-lib-date DATE=
  
** Styling

Each library object can be styled using a style property list that
defines:

- foreground color
- background color
- internal padding (tag and icon)
- external margin (in char)
- stroke width (in pixels)
- corner radius (in pixels) for the rounded box
- horizontal alignment (0 to 1) inside margins
- width (in characters)
- height as a scale of line height
- scale (for icon)
- ascent (for text)
- crop-left to crop object on the left
- crop-right to  crop object on the right
- collection to use for icon 
- font family
- font size
- font weight

* Icon repositories

Icons can be created by parsing remote collections whose license are
compatibles with GNU Emacs. The default size of an icon is exactly 2x1
characters such that it can be inserted inside a text without
disturbing alignment.

Each icon is cached locally to speed-up loading the next time you use
it. If for some reason the cache is corrupted you can force reload
using the svg-icon-get-data function. If you want to add new
collections (i.e. URL), make sure the icons are monochrome, that their
size is consistent and that they include a 'viewBox' node.
