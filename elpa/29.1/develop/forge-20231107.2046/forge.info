1 Introduction
**************

Forge allows you to work with Git forges, such as Github and Gitlab,
from the comfort of Magit and the rest of Emacs.

   Forge fetches issues, pull-requests and other data using the forge’s
API and stores that in a local database.  Additionally it fetches the
pull-request references using Git.  Forge implements various features
that use this data but the database and pull-request refs can also be
used by third-party packages.


File: forge.info,  Node: Supported Forges and Hosts,  Next: Getting Started,  Prev: Introduction,  Up: Top

2 Supported Forges and Hosts
****************************

Currently Forge supports two forges and three more forges partially.
Additionally it supports four semi-forges.  Support for more forges and
semi-forges can and will be added.

   Both forges and semi-forges provide web interfaces for Git
repositories.  Forges additionally support pull-requests and issues and
make those and other information available using an API.

   When a forge is only partially supported, then that means that only
the functionality that does not require the API is implemented, or in
other words, that the forge is only supported as a semi-forge.

   A host is a particular instance of a forge.  For example the hosts
<https://gitlab.com> and <https://salsa.debian.org> are both instances
of the Gitlab forge.  Forge supports some well known hosts out of the
box and additional hosts can easily be supported by adding entries to
the option ‘forge-alist’ (see *note Repository Detection::).

   For more details about the caveats mentioned below (and some others)
also see *note Getting Started::.

2.1 Supported Forges
====================

Github
------

Forge’s support for Github can be considered the "reference
implementation".  Support for other forges can lag behind a bit.

Github Caveats
..............

   • Forge uses the Github GraphQL API when possible but has to fall
     back to use the REST API in many cases because the former is still
     rather incomplete.

   • The Github GraphQL API has a hard-coded timeout on queries.  The
     only solution is to reduce the number of entities we query at once,
     which can be done by adjusting either the ‘forge.graphqlItemLimit’
     git variable or the field "GQL entity limit" in a status buffer.

   • Forge depends on the ‘updated_at’ field being updated when
     appropriate.  For Github pull-requests at least, that is not always
     done.

Github Hosts
............

   • <https://github.com>

Gitlab
------

Gitlab Caveats
..............

   • Forge cannot provide notifications because the Gitlab API does not
     expose those.

Gitlab Hosts
............

   • <https://gitlab.com>
   • <https://salsa.debian.org>
   • <https://framagit.org>

2.2 Partially Supported Forges
==============================

Gitea https://gitea.io
----------------------

This is the next forge whose API will be supported.

Gitea Hosts
...........

   • <https://codeberg.org>

Gogs https://gogs.io
--------------------

Once Gitea is supported it should be fairly simple to support Gogs too,
because the former is a fork of the latter and the APIs seem to still be
very similar.

Gogs Hosts
..........

   • <https://code.orgmode.org>

Bitbucket https://bitbucket.org
-------------------------------

I don’t plan to support Bitbucket’s API any time soon, and it gets less
likely that I will every do it every time I look at it.

Bitbucket Caveats
.................

   • The API documentation is poor and initial tests indicated that the
     implementation is buggy.

   • Atlassian’s offering contains two very distinct implementations
     that are both called "Bitbucket".  Forge only supports the
     implementation whose only instance is available at
     <https://bitbucket.org>, because I only have access to that.

   • Unlike all other forges, Bitbucket does not expose pull-requests as
     references in the upstream repository.  For that reason Forge
     actually treats it as a semi-forge, not as forge whose API is not
     supported yet.  This means that you cannot checkout pull-requests
     locally.  There is little hope that this will ever get fixed; the
     respective issue was opened six years ago and there has been no
     progress since: <https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issues/5814>.

Bitbucket Hosts

2.3 Supported Semi-Forges
=========================

Gitweb https://git-scm.com/docs/gitweb
--------------------------------------

Gitweb Caveats
..............

   • I could find only one public installation
     (<https://git.savannah.gnu.org>), which gives users the choice
     between Gitweb and Cgit.  The latter seems more popular (not just
     on this site).

Cgit https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about
-------------------------------------

Cgit Caveats
............

   • Different sites use different URL schemata and some of the bigger
     sites use a fork.  For this reason Forge has to provide several
     classes to support different variations of Cgit and you have to
     look at their definitions to figure out which one is the correct
     one for a particular installation.

Cgit Hosts
..........

   • <https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit>
   • <https://git.kernel.org>
   • <https://repo.or.cz>

Stgit https://codemadness.org/git/stagit/file/README.html
---------------------------------------------------------

Stgit Caveats
.............

   • Stgit cannot show logs for branches beside "master".  For that
     reason Forge takes users to a page listing the branches when they
     request the log for a particular branch (even for "master" whose
     log is just one click away from there).

Stgit Hosts
...........

   • <https://git.suckless.org>

Srht https://meta.sr.ht
-----------------------

Srht Caveats
............

   • Srht cannot show logs for branches beside "master".  For that
     reason Forge takes users to a page listing the branches when they
     request the log for a particular branch (even for "master" whose
     log is just one click away from there).

3 Getting Started
*****************

Initial setup turned out to more challenging for many users than I had
hoped.  I am trying to counter that by providing detailed instructions
that cover not just the happy path but also many of the issues users
have ran into in the past.  The recommended reading is longer than one
might wish, but skipping it does not necessarily save time.

   Forge uses the Ghub package to access the APIs of supported forges.
How this works and how to create and store a token is documented in
*note (ghub)Getting Started::.  Please read that in full before coming
back here and continuing with the subsections listed below.

   <https://github.com/magit/forge/wiki> lists additional resources;
including a link to a much shorter quick-start guide provided by a user.

File: forge.info,  Node: Loading Forge,  Next: Token Creation,  Up: Getting Started

3.1 Loading Forge
=================

Loading Magit doesn’t cause Forge to be loaded automatically.  Adding
something like this to your init file takes care of that:

     (with-eval-after-load 'magit
       (require 'forge))

Or if you use ‘use-package’:

     (use-package forge
       :after magit)


File: forge.info,  Node: Token Creation,  Next: Initial Pull,  Prev: Loading Forge,  Up: Getting Started

3.2 Token Creation
==================

Forge uses the Ghub package to access the APIs of supported Git forges.
How this works and how to create and store a token is documented in
*note (ghub)Getting Started::.

   Ghub used to provide a setup wizard, but that had to be removed for
reasons given in the manual just mentioned.  Nowadays there is no way
around reading the documentation and doing this manually I am afraid.

   Forge requires the following token scopes.

   • For Github these scopes are required.

        • ‘repo’ grants full read/write access to private and public
          repositories.
        • ‘user’ grants access to profile information.
        • ‘read:org’ grants read-only access to organization membership.

     More information about these and other scopes can be found at
     <https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps>.

   • For Gitlab instances ‘api’ is the only required scope.  It gives
     read and write access to everything.  The Gitlab API provides more
     fine-grained scopes for read-only access, but when any write access
     at all is required, then it is all or nothing.


File: forge.info,  Node: Initial Pull,  Next: Repository Detection,  Prev: Token Creation,  Up: Getting Started

3.3 Initial Pull
================

To start using Forge in a certain repository visit the Magit status
buffer for that repository and type ‘f n’ (‘forge-pull’).
Alternatively, you can use ‘M-x forge-add-repository’, which makes it
possible to add a forge repository without pulling all topics and even
without having to clone the respective Git repository.

   You must set up a token *before* you can add the first repository.
See *note Token Creation::.

   The first time ‘forge-pull’ is run in a repository, an entry for that
repository is added to the database and a new value is added to the Git
variable ‘remote.<remote>.fetch’, which fetches all pull-requests.
(‘+refs/pull/*/head:refs/pullreqs/*’ for Github)

   ‘forge-pull’ then fetches topics and other information using the
forge’s API and pull-request references using Git.

   The initial fetch can take a while but most of that is done
asynchronously.  Storing the information in the database is done
synchronously though, so there can be a noticeable hang at the end.
Subsequent fetches are much faster.

   Fetching issues from Github is much faster than fetching from other
forges because making a handful of GraphQL requests is much faster than
making hundreds of REST requests.


File: forge.info,  Node: Repository Detection,  Next: Caveats,  Prev: Initial Pull,  Up: Getting Started

3.4 Repository Detection
========================

Ghub does *not* associate a given local repository with a repository on
a forge.  The Forge package itself takes care of this.  In doing so it
ignores the Git variable ‘ghub.host’ and other ‘*.host’ variables used
by Ghub.  (But ‘github.user’ and other variables used to specify the
user are honored).

   Forge associates the local repository with a forge repository by
first determining which remote is associated with the upstream
repository and then looking that up in ‘forge-alist’.

   If only one remote exists, then Forge uses that unconditionally.  To
reduce the number of support requests, this is even the case if the Git
variable ‘forge.remote’ names another, non-existent, remote.

   If several remotes exist, then a remote may be selected based on its
name.  Almost always we want to fetch the data associated with the
upstream repository, so that is what the logic described here tries to
achieve.  The convention is to name the upstream remote "origin", and if
that convention were universally followed, then things would be trivial.
However many people name the upstream remote "upstream", which also
makes sense.

     Note, however, that even though a surprising number of people do
     just that, it does not make any sense to use the name "origin" to
     refer to a fork; not even to your own fork.  A fork is a *copy* of
     the original, "copy" is an antonym for "original", and the word
     "origin" is not only closely related to but even contained in the
     word "original".  Naming a fork the "origin" is at best extremely
     confusing.

     copy
          a thing made to be similar or identical to another.

     original
          the earliest form of something, from which copies may be made.

     origin
          the point or place where something begins, arises, or is
          derived.

   If several remotes exist, then the following remote names are tried
in order and the first remote thus named that exists in the repository
is used.

  1. The value of the Git variable ‘forge.remote’, if set.  If the
     variable has a value but no remote by the specified name exists,
     then a warning is shown, but otherwise this conflict is ignored.
     This behavior is arguably odd, but due to historic and pragmatic
     reasons it is the least painful path forward.

  2. The remote named ‘upstream’, if it exists.

  3. The remote named ‘origin’, if it exists.

   The remote named "upstream" is preferred over the remote named
"origin" because the existence of the former strongly suggests that the
latter is either not used in this repository (in which case the order
does not matter) or else it is abused as the name of a fork (in which
case "upstream" must be preferred).

 -- Variable: forge.remote
     The value of this variable specifies the remote from which Forge
     fetches data.  It is usually best to leave this unspecified and to
     rely on the behavior described above.

     If the remote has to be specified explicitly, then this should be
     done locally, for a single repository.

     Only ever set this globally, if you consistently use a certain name
     to refer to the upstream repository and it isn’t one of "upstream"
     or "origin", and you *never* use that name to refer to a repository
     that does *not* refer to the upstream repository.

‘N r’ (‘forge-forge.remote’)
     This command changes the value of the ‘forge.remote’ Git variable
     in the current repository.

   If this variable is set, then Forge uses the remote by that name, if
it exists, the same way it may have used ‘origin’ if the the variable
were undefined.  I.e., it does not fall through to try ‘origin’ if no
remote by your chosen name exists.

   Once the upstream remote has been determined, Forge looks it up in
‘forge-alist’, using the host part of the URL as the key.  For example
the key for ‘git@github.com:magit/forge.git’ is ‘github.com’.

 -- User Option: forge-alist
     This option defines forge hosts known to Forge.

     Each entry has the form ‘(GITHOST APIHOST ID CLASS)’.

        • GITHOST is matched against the host part of Git remote urls
          using ‘forge--url-regexp’ to identify the forge.
        • APIHOST is the api endpoint of the forge’s api.
        • ID is used to identify the forge in the local database.
        • CLASS is the class to be used for repository from the forge.

     GITHOST and APIHOST can be changed, but ID and CLASS are final.  If
     you change ID, then the identity of every repository from that
     forge changes.  If you change CLASS, then things start falling
     apart.

     There can be multiple elements that only differ in GITHOST.  Among
     those, the canonical element should come first.  Any elements that
     have the same APIHOST must also have the same ID, and vice-versa.

     When adding a new entry, look at the default entries.

     Complications:

        • When connecting to a Github Enterprise edition whose REST
          API’s end point is "<host>/v3" and whose GraphQL API’s end
          point is "<host>/graphql", then use "<host>/v3" as APIHOST.
          This is a historic accident.  See issue #174.

        • This variable does not account for the possibility that the
          git repository does not use the same address as the web
          interface.  That is another historic accident and if many
          users are affected by it, we might have to fix it properly.
          If you would like that, comment on issue #532.

          For now a workaround has to be used.  Assuming the web
          interface is available at "example.com" and the repository is
          at "ssh.example.com", use "example.com" as GITHOST and add
          something like this to ".gitconfig":

               [url "git@ssh.example.com"]
                   insteadOf = git@example.com"

3.5 Caveats
===========

   • Fetched information is stored in a database.  The table schemata of
     that database have not been finalized yet.  Until that has happened
     it will occasionally have to be discarded.  That isn’t such a huge
     deal because for now the database does not contain any information
     that cannot simply be fetched again, see *note Initial Pull::.

   • Fetching is implemented under the assumption that the API can be
     asked to list the things that have changed since we last checked.
     Unfortunately the APIs are not bug-free, so this is not always the
     case.  If in doubt, then re-fetch an individual topic to ensure it
     is up-to-date using the command ‘forge-pull-topic’.

   • Some other, forge-specific, caveats are mentioned in *note
     Supported Forges and Hosts::.


File: forge.info,  Node: Usage,  Next: FAQ,  Prev: Getting Started,  Up: Top

4 Usage
*******

Once information has been pulled from a repository’s forge for the first
time, Forge adds two additional sections, named "Pull requests" and
"Issues" to Magit’s status buffer.  It is also possible to add a
repository to the local database without pulling all the data, which is
useful if you want to create a single pull-request.

‘N a’ (‘forge-add-repository’)
     This command adds a repository to the database.

     It offers to either pull topics (now and in the future) or to only
     pull individual topics when the user invokes ‘forge-pull-topic’.

   Some of Forge’s commands are only bound when point is within one of
these sections but other commands are also available elsewhere in
Magit’s status buffer and/or from Magit’s transient commands.

‘N’ (‘forge-dispatch’)
     This prefix command is available in any Magit buffer and provides
     access to several of the available Forge commands.  Most of these
     commands are also bound elsewhere, but some are not.  See the
     following sections for information about the available commands.

     Throughout this manual you will find many bindings that begin with
     ‘N’, but if you prefer to continue to use ‘forge-dispatch’’s older
     binding you can substitute ‘'’ for that.

File: forge.info,  Node: Pulling,  Next: Branching,  Up: Usage

4.1 Pulling
===========

The commands that fetch forge data are available from the same transient
prefix command (‘magit-fetch’ on ‘f’) that is used to fetch Git data.
If option ‘magit-pull-or-fetch’ is non-nil, then they are also available
from the ‘magit-pull’ transient (on ‘F’).

‘f n’ (‘forge-pull’)
‘N f f’
     This command uses a forge’s API to fetch topics and other
     information about the current repository and stores the fetched
     information in the database.  It also fetches notifications for all
     repositories from the same forge host.  (Currently this is limited
     to Github.)  Finally it fetches pull-request references using Git.

     After using this command for the first time in a given repository
     the status buffer for that repository always lists the
     pull-requests and issues.  See *note Initial Pull::.

‘f N’ (‘forge-pull-notifications’)
‘N f n’
     This command uses a forge’s API to fetch all notifications from
     that forge including, but not limited to, the notifications for the
     current repository.

     Fetching all notifications fetches associated topics even if you
     have not started fetching *all* topics for the respective
     repositories (using ‘forge-pull’), but it does not cause the topics
     to be listed in the status buffer of such "uninitialized"
     repositories.

   Note how pulling data from a forge’s API works the same way as
pulling Git data does; you do it explicitly when you want to see the
work done by others.

   This is less disruptive, more reliable, and easier to understand than
if Forge did the pulling by itself at random intervals.  It might
however mean that you occasionally invoke a command expecting the most
recent data to be available and then have to abort to pull first.  The
same can happen with Git, e.g., you might attempt to merge a branch that
you know exists but haven’t actually pulled yet.

‘N f t’ (‘forge-pull-topic’)
     This command uses a forge’s API to fetch a single pull-request and
     stores it in the database.

     Normally you wouldn’t want to pull a single pull-request by itself,
     but due to a bug in the Github API you might sometimes have to do
     so.

     Fetching is implemented under the assumption that the API can be
     asked to list the things that have changed since we last checked.
     Unfortunately the APIs are not bug-free, so this is not always the
     case.  If in doubt, then re-fetch an individual topic to ensure it
     is up-to-date using the command ‘forge-pull-topic’.


File: forge.info,  Node: Branching,  Next: Working with Topics,  Prev: Pulling,  Up: Usage

4.2 Branching
=============

Forge provides commands for creating and checking out a new branch or
work tree from a pull-request.  These commands are available from the
same transient prefix commands as the suffix commands used to create and
check out branches and work trees in a more generic fashion
(‘magit-branch’ on ‘b’ and ‘magit-worktree’ on ‘%’).

‘b F’ (‘forge-branch-pullreq’)
     This command creates and configures a new branch from a
     pull-request, creating and configuring a new remote if necessary.

     The name of the local branch is the same as the name of the remote
     branch that you are being asked to merge, unless the contributor
     could not be bothered to properly name the branch before opening
     the pull-request.  The most likely such case is when you are being
     asked to merge something like "fork/master" into "origin/master".
     In such cases the local branch will be named "pr-N", where ‘N’ is
     the pull-request number.

     These variables are always set by this command:

        • ‘branch.<name>.pullRequest’ is set to the pull-request number.
        • ‘branch.<name>.pullRequestRemote’ is set to the remote on
          which the pull-request branch is located.
        • ‘branch.<name>.pushRemote’ is set to the same remote as
          ‘branch.<name>.pullRequestRemote’ if that is possible,
          otherwise it is set to the upstream remote.
        • ‘branch.<name>.description’ is set to the pull-request title.
        • ‘branch.<name>.rebase’ is set to ‘true’ because there should
          be no merge commits among the commits in a pull-request.

     This command also configures the upstream and the push-remote of
     the local branch that it creates.

     The branch against which the pull-request was opened is always used
     as the upstream.  This makes it easy to see what commits you are
     being asked to merge in the section titled something like "Unmerged
     into origin/master".

     Like for other commands that create a branch, it depends on the
     option ‘magit-branch-prefer-remote-upstream’ whether the remote
     branch itself or the respective local branch is used as the
     upstream, so this section may also be titled, e.g., "Unmerged into
     master".

     When necessary and possible, the remote pull-request branch is
     configured to be used as the push-target.  This makes it easy to
     see what further changes the contributor has made since you last
     reviewed their changes in the section titled something like
     "Unpulled from origin/new-feature" or "Unpulled from
     fork/new-feature".

        • If the pull-request branch is located in the upstream
          repository, then you probably have set ‘remote.pushDefault’ to
          that repository.  However some users like to set that variable
          to their personal fork, even if they have push access to the
          upstream, so ‘branch.<name>.pushRemote’ is set anyway.

        • If the pull-request branch is located inside a fork, then you
          are usually able to push to that branch, because Github by
          default allows the recipient of a pull-request to push to the
          remote pull-request branch even if it is located in a fork.
          The contributor has to explicitly disable this.

             • If you are not allowed to push to the pull-request branch
               on the fork, then a branch by the same name located in
               the upstream repository is configured as the push-target.

             • A—sadly rather common—special case is when the
               contributor didn’t bother to use a dedicated branch for
               the pull-request.

               The most likely such case is when you are being asked to
               merge something like "fork/master" into "origin/master".
               The special push permission mentioned above is never
               granted for the branch that is the repository’s default
               branch, and that would almost certainly be the case in
               this scenario.

               To enable you to easily push somewhere anyway, the local
               branch is named "pr-N" (where ‘N’ is the pull-request
               number) and the upstream repository is used as the
               push-remote.

             • Finally, if you are allowed to push to the pull-request
               branch and the contributor had the foresight to use a
               dedicated branch, then the fork is configured as the
               push-remote.

          The push-remote is configured using
          ‘branch.<name>.pushRemote’, even if the used value is
          identical to that of ‘remote.pushDefault’, just in case you
          change the value of the latter later on.  Additionally the
          variable ‘branch.<name>.pullRequestRemote’ is set to the
          remote on which the pull-request branch is located.

‘b f’ (‘forge-checkout-pullreq’)
     This command creates and configures a new branch from a
     pull-request the same way ‘forge-branch-pullreq’ does.
     Additionally it checks out the new branch.

‘Z n’ (‘forge-checkout-worktree’)
     This command creates and configures a new branch from a
     pull-request the same way ‘forge-branch-pullreq’ does.
     Additionally it checks out the new branch using a new working tree.

 -- User Option: forge-checkout-worktree-read-directory-function
     This function is used by ‘forge-checkout-worktree’ to read read the
     new worktree directory where it checks out to pull-request.  It
     takes the pull-request as the only argument and must return a
     directory.

   When you delete a pull-request branch, which was created using one of
the above three commands, then ‘magit-branch-delete’ usually offers to
also delete the corresponding remote.  It does not offer to delete a
remote if (1) the remote is the upstream remote, and/or (2) if other
branches are being fetched from the remote.

   Note that you have to delete the local branch (e.g., "feature") for
this to work.  If you delete the tracking branch (e.g., "fork/feature"),
then the remote is never removed.

4.3 Working with Topics
=======================

We call both issues and pull-requests "topics".  The contributions to
the conversation are called "posts".

File: forge.info,  Node: Visiting Topics,  Next: Listing Topics and Notifications,  Up: Working with Topics

4.3.1 Visiting Topics
---------------------

Magit’s status buffer contains lists of issues and pull-requests.
Topics are ordered by last modification time.  All open issues and some
recently edited and closed topics are listed.

   Forge provides some commands that act on the listed topics.  These
commands can also be used in other contexts, such as when point is on a
commit or branch section.

‘C-c C-w’ (‘forge-browse-TYPE’)
‘C-c C-w’ (‘forge-browse-dwim’)
‘N b r’ (‘forge-browse-remote’)
‘N b I’ (‘forge-browse-issues’)
‘N b P’ (‘forge-browse-pullreqs’)
‘N b t’ (‘forge-browse-topic’)
‘N b i’ (‘forge-browse-issue’)
‘N b p’ (‘forge-browse-pullreq’)
     These commands visit the topic, issue(s), pull-request(s), post,
     branch, commit, or remote at point in a browser.

     This is implemented using various commands named
     ‘forge-browse-TYPE’, and the key binding is defined by remapping
     ‘magit-browse-thing’ (as defined in ‘magit-mode-map)’.  For commit
     sections this key is bound to ‘forge-browse-dwim’, which prefers a
     topic over a branch and a branch over a commit.

‘<RET>’ (‘forge-visit-TYPE’)
‘C-c C-v’ (‘forge-visit-topic’)
‘N v t’ (‘forge-visit-topic’)
‘N v i’ (‘forge-visit-issue’)
‘N v p’ (‘forge-visit-pullreq’)
     These commands visit the pull-request(s), issue(s), or repository
     in a separate buffer.

     The ‘RET’ binding is only available when point is on a issue or
     pull-request section because that key is already bound to something
     else for most of Magit’s own sections.  ‘C-c C-v’ however is also
     available on regular commit (e.g., in a log) and branch sections.

     This is implemented using various commands named ‘forge-visit-TYPE’
     and the key binding is defined by remapping ‘magit-visit-thing’ (as
     defined in ‘magit-mode-map’).


File: forge.info,  Node: Listing Topics and Notifications,  Next: Creating Topics,  Prev: Visiting Topics,  Up: Working with Topics

4.3.2 Listing Topics and Notifications
--------------------------------------

By default Forge lists a subset of topics directly in the Magit status
buffer.  It also provides commands to list topics and notifications in
separate buffers.

   Forge adds the following functions to ‘magit-status-sections-hook’:

 -- Function: forge-insert-pullreqs
     This function inserts a list of the most recent and/or open
     pull-requests.

 -- Function: forge-insert-issues
     This function inserts a list of the most recent and/or open issues.

 -- User Option: forge-topic-list-limit
     This option limits the number of topics listed by the above
     functions.

     All unread topics are always shown.  If the value of this option
     has the form ‘(OPEN . CLOSED)’, then the integer ‘OPEN’ specifies
     the maximal number of topics and ‘CLOSED’ specifies the maximal
     number of closed topics.  IF ‘CLOSED’ is negative then show no
     closed topics until the command ‘forge-toggle-closed-visibility’
     changes the sign.

 -- Command: forge-toggle-closed-visibility
     This command toggles whether the above two functions list recently
     closed issues in the current buffer.

   The following functions are also suitable for
‘magit-status-sections-hook’:

 -- Function: forge-insert-assigned-pullreqs
     This function inserts a list of open pull-requests that are
     assigned to you.

 -- Function: forge-insert-requested-reviews
     This function inserts a list of open pull-requests that are
     awaiting your review.

 -- Function: forge-insert-authored-pullreqs
     This function inserts a list of open pull-requests that are
     authored by you.

 -- Function: forge-insert-assigned-issues
     This function inserts a list of open issues that are assigned to
     you.

 -- Function: forge-insert-authored-issues
     This function inserts a list of open issues that are authored by
     you.

   The following commands list repositories, notifications and topics in
dedicated buffers:

‘N l r’ (‘forge-list-repositories’)
     This command lists all known repositories in a separate buffer.

‘N l n’ (‘forge-list-notifications’)
     This command lists all notifications for all forges in a separate
     buffer.

‘N l p’ (‘forge-list-pullreqs’)
     This command lists the current repository’s pull-requests in a
     separate buffer.

‘N l i’ (‘forge-list-issues’)
     This command lists the current repository’s issues in a separate
     buffer.

 -- Command: forge-list-labeled-pullreqs
     This command lists the current repository’s open pull-requests that
     are labeled with a label read from the user.

 -- Command: forge-list-labeled-issues
     This command lists the current repository’s open issues that are
     labeled with a label read from the user.

 -- Command: forge-list-assigned-pullreqs
     This command lists the current repository’s open pull-requests that
     are assigned to you in a separate buffer.

 -- Command: forge-list-assigned-issues
     This command lists the current repository’s open issues that are
     assigned to you in a separate buffer.

 -- Command: forge-list-requested-reviews
     This command lists pull-requests of the current repository that are
     awaiting your review in a separate buffer.

 -- Command: forge-list-authored-pullreqs
     This command lists the current repository’s open pull-requests that
     are authored by you in a separate buffer.

 -- Command: forge-list-authored-issues
     This command lists the current repository’s open issues that are
     authored by you in a separate buffer.

 -- Command: forge-list-owned-pullreqs
     This command lists open pull-requests from all the repositories
     that you own.  Options ‘forge-owned-accounts’ and
     ‘forge-owned-ignored’ controls which repositories are considered to
     be owned by you.  Only Github is supported for now.

 -- Command: forge-list-owned-issues
     This command lists open issues from all the repositories that you
     own.  Options ‘forge-owned-accounts’ and ‘forge-owned-ignored’
     controls which repositories are considered to be owned by you.
     Only Github is supported for now.

 -- User Option: forge-owned-accounts
     This is an alist of accounts that are owned by you.  This should
     include your username as well as any organization that you own.
     Used by the commands ‘forge-list-owned-issues’,
     ‘forge-list-owned-pullreqs’ and ‘forge-fork’.

     Each element has the form ‘(ACCOUNT . PLIST)’.  The following
     properties are currently being used:

        • ‘remote-name’ The default name suggested by ‘forge-fork’ for a
          fork created within this account.  If unspecified, then the
          name of the account is used.

     Example: ‘(("tarsius") ("emacsmirror" remote-name "mirror"))’.

 -- User Option: forge-owned-ignored
     This is a list of repository names that are considered to not be
     owned by you even though they would have been considered to be
     owned by you based on ‘forge-owned-accounts’.

4.3.3 Creating Topics
---------------------

‘N c p’ (‘forge-create-pullreq’)
‘C-c C-n [on "Pull requests" section]’
     This command creates a new pull-request for the current repository.

‘N c i’ (‘forge-create-issue’)
‘C-c C-n [on "Issues" section]’
     This command creates a new issue for the current repository.


File: forge.info,  Node: Editing Topics and Posts,  Prev: Creating Topics,  Up: Working with Topics

4.3.4 Editing Topics and Posts
------------------------------

We call both issues and pull-requests "topics".  The contributions to
the conversation are called "posts".  The post that initiated the
conversation is also called a post.

   These commands are available only from the topic buffer (i.e., from
the buffer that shows the posts on a topic).  Other commands that also
work in other buffers are available here also.  For example ‘C-c C-w’ on
a post visits that post in a browser.

‘C-c C-n’ (‘forge-create-post’)
‘C-c C-r’
     This command allows users to create a new post on an existing
     topic.  It opens a buffer in which the user can write the post.
     When the post is done, then the user has to submit using ‘C-c C-c’.

     If the region is active and marks part of an existing post, then
     that part of the post is quoted.  Otherwise, or if a prefix
     argument is used, then the complete post that point is currently on
     is quoted.

‘C-c C-e [on a post section]’ (‘forge-edit-post’)
     This command visits an existing post in a separate buffer.  When
     the changes to the post are done, then the user has to submit using
     ‘C-c C-c’.

‘C-c C-e [on "Title" section]’ (‘forge-edit-topic-title’)
     This command reads a new title for an existing topic in the
     minibuffer.

‘C-c C-e [on "State" section]’ (‘forge-edit-topic-state’)
     This command toggles the state of an existing topic between "open"
     and "closed".

‘C-c C-e [on "Draft" section]’ (‘forge-edit-topic-draft’)
     This command toggles whether an existing topic is a draft or not.

‘C-c C-e [on "Labels" section]’ (‘forge-edit-topic-labels’)
     This command reads a list of labels for an existing topic in the
     minibuffer.

‘C-c C-e [on "Marks" section]’ (‘forge-edit-topic-marks’)
     This command reads a list of marks for an existing topic in the
     minibuffer.

     Marks are like labels except that they are not shared with anyone
     else.  To create a mark that topics can subsequently be marked with
     use the command ‘forge-create-mark’.  Existing marks can be edited
     using the command ‘forge-edit-mark’.

‘C-c C-e [on "Assignees" section]’ (‘forge-edit-topic-assignees’)
     This command reads a list of assignees for an existing topic in the
     minibuffer.

‘C-c C-e [on "Review-Requests" section]’ (‘forge-edit-topic-review-requests’)
     This command reads a list of people who you would like to review an
     existing topic in the minibuffer.

‘C-c C-e [on "Note" section]’
‘M-x forge-edit-topic-note’
     This lets you edit your private note about a topic.

‘C-c C-k [on a comment section]’ (‘forge-delete-comment’)
     This command deletes the comment at point.

‘m M [if enabled]’ (‘forge-merge’)
‘N M [if enabled]’
     This command merges the current pull-request using the forge’s API.
     If there is no current pull-request or with a prefix argument, then
     it reads a pull-request to visit instead.

     The "merge method" to be used is read from the user.

     Use of this command is discouraged.  Unless the remote repository
     is configured to disallow that, you should instead merge locally
     and then push the target branch.  Forges detect that you have done
     that and respond by automatically marking the pull-request as
     merged.

   Creating a new post and editing an existing post are similar to
creating a new commit and editing the message of an existing commit.  In
both cases the message has to be written in a separate buffer and then
the process has to be finished or canceled using a separate command.

   The following commands are available in buffers used to edit posts:

‘C-c C-c’ (‘forge-post-submit’)
     This command submits the post that is being edited in the current
     buffer.

‘C-c C-k’ (‘forge-post-cancel’)
     This command cancels the post that is being edited in the current
     buffer.

‘C-c C-e’ (‘forge-post-dispatch’)
     This prefix command features the above two commands as suffixes,
     and when creating a pull-request also the following command.  More
     suffix commands will likely be added in the future.

‘C-c C-e d’ (‘forge-post-toggle-draft’)
     This command toggles whether the pull-request being created is a
     draft.


File: forge.info,  Node: Miscellaneous,  Prev: Working with Topics,  Up: Usage

4.4 Miscellaneous
=================

‘N c f’ (‘forge-fork’)
     This command adds an additional remote to the current repository.
     The remote can either point at an existing repository or one that
     has to be created first by forking it to an account the user has
     access to.

     Currently this only supports Github and Gitlab.

‘N a’ (‘forge-add-repository’)
     This command reads a repository from the user and adds it to the
     database.  The repository can be provided as a URL, a name, or in
     the form OWNER/NAME.  This is subject to ‘magit-clone-name-alist’.

     This command offers to either pull topics (now and in the future)
     or to only pull individual topics when the user invokes
     ‘forge-pull-topic’.

‘N t t’ (‘forge-toggle-display-in-status-buffer’)
     This command toggles whether any topics are displayed in the
     current Magit status buffer.

‘N t c’ (‘forge-toggle-closed-visibility’)
     This command toggles whether closed topics are shown in the Magit
     status buffer.

 -- Command: forge-add-user-repositories
     This command reads a host and a username from the user and adds all
     of that user’s repositories on that host to the local database.

     This may take a while.  Only Github is supported at the moment.

 -- Command: forge-add-organization-repositories
     This command reads a host and an organization from the user and
     adds all the organization’s repositories on that host to the local
     database.

     This may take a while.  Only Github is supported at the moment.

 -- Command: forge-remove-repository
     This command reads a repository and removes it from the local
     database.

 -- Command: forge-remove-topic-locally
     This command reads a topic and removes it from the local database.
     The topic is not removed from the forge and, if it is later
     modified, then it will be added to the database again.

     Due to how the supported APIs work, it would be too expensive to
     automatically remove topics from the local database that were
     removed from the forge.  The only purpose of this command is to
     allow you to manually clean up the local database.

 -- Command: forge-reset-database
     This command moves the current database file to the trash and
     creates a new empty database.

     This is useful after the database’s table schemata have changed,
     which will happen a few times while the Forge functionality is
     still under heavy development.

A.1 Is it possible to create a single pull-request without pulling everything?
==============================================================================

Yes.  ‘M-x forge-add-repository’ offers to add a repository to the
database without also fetching all pull-requests and issues.


File: forge.info,  Node: error in process filter HTTP Error 502 "Bad gateway",  Prev: Is it possible to create a single pull-request without pulling everything?,  Up: FAQ

A.2 ‘error in process filter: HTTP Error: 502, "Bad gateway"’
=============================================================

This is a frequently occurring error.  Adding some formatting the full
error is:

     error in process filter: ghub--signal-error: HTTP Error: 502,
       "Bad gateway", "/graphql",
       ((data . "null")
        (errors ((message . "Something went wrong while executing your query.
           This may be the result of a timeout, or it could be a GitHub bug.
           Please include `CC2C:4FEA:A1771C1:CBF40CE:5C33F7E5`
           when reporting this issue."))))

   This indicates that something went wrong within Github’s network.
See
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#5xx_server_errors>.
The appended error message also says as much: "This may be the result of
a timeout, or it could be a GitHub bug."

   It appears that this happens more often in big repositories,
especially during the initial pull, but this may be an illusion; it is
known to also happens for smaller, incremental requests.

   I believe that more data just means more requests and thus more
opportunities for things to go wrong.  It seems unlikely that this is
due to us requesting too much data at once (in that case we would get a
different error from GraphQL, not HTTP). When fetching lots of data,
then we do not request one large response but make many requests and we
then collect the many responses (pagination forces us to do that).

   The timeout may be due to many requests from other people arriving at
some Github-internal bottleneck at the same time, or it may be due to
cold caches and overly aggressive timeouts.  We just don’t know; it’s
their infrastructure.

   The second problem is that we currently simply error out if we get
this error.  This could be changed and eventually it will be, but for
the time being your only option is to just try again, possibly
repeatedly and possibly after a delay to give whatever congestion may
exist on the other end a chance to clear or to give their caches a
chance to warm up.

   This was also discussed in <https://github.com/magit/forge/issues/20>
and <https://github.com/magit/ghub/issues/83>.
