  "Whether the pull-request refspec is added when setting up a repository.

This controls whether running `forge-pull' for the first time in
a repository also adds a refspec that fetches all pull-requests.
In repositories with huge numbers of pull-requests you might want
to not do so, in which case you should set this option to `ask'.

You can also set this to nil and later add the refspec explicitly
for a repository using the command `forge-add-pullreq-refspec'."
