Overview
********

Ledger is a command line accounting tool that provides double-entry
accounting based on a text journal.  It provides no bells or whistles,
and returns the user to the days before user interfaces were even a
twinkling in their father’s CRT.

   Ledger-mode assists you in maintaining input files for Ledger,
running reports and much more...

1.1 Quick Installation
======================

The Emacs lisp source for Ledger-mode is included with the source
distribution of Ledger.  It is entirely included in the ‘lisp’
subdirectory.  To use Ledger-mode, include the following in your Emacs
initialization file (‘~/.emacs’, ‘~/.emacs.d/init.el’, or
‘~/.Aquamacs/Preferences.el’).

     (autoload 'ledger-mode "ledger-mode" "A major mode for Ledger" t)
     (add-to-list 'load-path
                  (expand-file-name "/path/to/ledger/source/lisp/"))
     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.ledger$" . ledger-mode))

   This sets up Emacs to automatically recognize files that end with
‘.ledger’ and start Ledger-mode.  Nothing else should be required as
long as the ledger command line utility is properly installed.

1.2 Menus
=========

The vast majority of Ledger-mode functionality is available from the
Emacs menu system.  The keystrokes are shown in the menu to help you
learn the faster keyboard methods.


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Quick Demo,  Prev: Menus,  Up: Introduction to Ledger-mode

1.3 Quick Demo
==============

Load the demo file ‘demo.ledger’ from the Ledger source ‘test/input’
directory.  The ledger will be loaded and font highlighted.  At this
point you could manually edit transactions and run Ledger from a
convenient command line.

1.3.1 Quick Add
---------------

As simple as the Ledger transaction format is, it can still be daunting
to add many transactions manually.  Ledger provides two ways to add
transactions with minimal typing.  Both are based on the idea that most
transactions are repetitions of earlier transactions.

   In the ‘demo.ledger’ buffer enter a date using the correct format.
Then type the first few characters of another payee in the ‘demo.ledger’
buffer.  Type ‘C-c TAB’.  Ledger-mode will search for a Payee that has
the same beginning and copy the rest of the transaction to you new
entry.

   Additionally you can use the ledger ‘xact’ command, by either typing
‘C-c C-a’ or using ‘Add Transaction’ menu entry.  Then typing a close
match to the payee.  Ledger-mode will call ‘ledger xact’ with the data
you enter and place the transaction in the proper chronological place in
the ledger.  The date format can be changed by modifying
‘ledger-default-date-format’.


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Reconciliation,  Next: Reports,  Prev: Quick Add,  Up: Quick Demo

1.3.2 Reconciliation
--------------------

The biggest task of maintaining a ledger is ensuring that it matches the
outside world.  This process is called reconciliation (*note Basics of
Reconciliation::) and can be quite onerous.  Ledger-mode attempts to
make it as painless as possible.

   In the ‘demo.ledger’ buffer type ‘C-c C-r’.  If cursor is on an
account, Ledger-mode will propose this account, or in the Minibuffer,
will prompt for an account to reconcile.  Hit ‘RET’ if you are happy
with proposed account, or enter ‘Checking’ as example.  Emacs will then
prompt for a target value.  The target value is the amount you want the
cleared transactions in the buffer to total.  Normally this would be the
ending value from your bank statement, or the latest value in your
on-line transaction summary.  Enter ‘1710’.  Note that Ledger-mode
assumes you are using ‘$’ (USD) as your default commodity, this can be
easily changed in the customization variables.  *Note Ledger-mode
Customization::.

   You now see a list of uncleared transactions in a buffer below the
‘demo.ledger’ buffer.  Touching the ‘SPC’ bar will mark a transaction as
pending and display the current cleared (and pending) balance, along
with the difference remaining to meet your target.  Clear the first
three transactions, and you will see the difference to target reach
‘$0’.  End the reconciliation by typing ‘C-c C-c’.  This saves the
‘demo.ledger’ buffer and marks the transactions and finally cleared.
Type ‘q’ to close out the reconciliation buffer.


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Reports,  Next: Narrowing,  Prev: Reconciliation,  Up: Quick Demo

1.3.3 Reports
-------------

The real power of Ledger is in its reporting capabilities.  Reports can
be run and displayed in a separate Emacs buffer.  In the ‘demo.ledger’
buffer, type ‘C-c C-o C-r’.  In the Minibuffer Emacs will prompt for a
report name.  There are a few built-in reports, and you can add any
report you need *Note Adding and Editing Reports::.

   In the Minibuffer type ‘account’.  When prompted for an account type
‘checking’.  In a buffer named ‘*Ledger Report*’, you will see a Ledger
register report.  You can move around the buffer, with the point on a
transaction, type ‘RET’.  Ledger-mode will take you directly to that
transaction in the ‘demo.ledger’ buffer.

   Another built-in report is the balance report.  In the ‘demo.ledger’
buffer, type ‘C-c C-o C-r’.  When prompted for a report to run, type
‘bal’, and a balance report of all accounts will be shown.


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Narrowing,  Prev: Reports,  Up: Quick Demo

1.3.4 Narrowing
---------------

A ledger file can get very large.  It can be helpful to collapse the
buffer to display only the transactions you are interested in.
Ledger-mode copies the ‘occur’ mode functionality.  Typing ‘C-c C-f’ and
entering any regex in the Minibuffer will show only transactions that
match the regex.  The regex can be on any field, or amount.  Use ‘C-c
C-g’ after editing transactions to re-apply the current regex.  Cancel
the narrowing by typing ‘C-c C-f’ again.

2.1 Navigating Transactions
===========================

In addition to the usual Emacs navigation commands, ledger-mode offers
several additional commands to ease navigation.  ‘M-n’ and ‘M-p’
navigate between next and previous xacts or directives.

   Additionally, M-x ledger-navigate-previous-uncleared and M-x
ledger-navigate-next-uncleared navigate to the next and previous
uncleared transactions.


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Adding Transactions,  Next: Copying Transactions,  Prev: Navigating Transactions,  Up: The Ledger Buffer

2.2 Adding Transactions
=======================

Beyond the two ways of quickly adding transactions (*note Quick Add::)
Ledger-mode assists you by providing robust ‘TAB’ completion for payees
and accounts.  Ledger-mode will scan the existing buffer for payees and
accounts.  Included files are not currently included in the completion
scan.  Ledger-mode respects Emacs’s variables that govern ‘TAB’
completion, see especially ‘tab-always-indent’.

   To cycle between completions when hitting ‘TAB’ multiple times, you
can adjust the standard completion configuration like this:

     (add-hook 'ledger-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (setq-local tab-always-indent 'complete)
                 (setq-local completion-cycle-threshold t)
                 (setq-local ledger-complete-in-steps t)))

   Ledger-mode will help you keep your amounts aligned.  When indenting
or completing, Ledger-mode will automatically place any amounts such
that their last digit is aligned to the column specified by
‘ledger-post-amount-alignment-column’, which defaults to ‘52’.  *Note
Ledger Post Customization Group::.

   To prevent the automatic realignment of amounts, disable
‘ledger-post-auto-align’.  *Note Ledger Post Customization Group::.

File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Setting a Transactions Effective Date,  Next: Quick Balance Display,  Prev: Adding Transactions,  Up: Adding Transactions

2.2.1 Setting a Transactions Effective Date
-------------------------------------------

Ledger provides for adding information to a transaction that add details
to the dates.  For example, you can specify when the transaction was
entered, when the transaction was cleared, or when individual postings
were cleared.  Ledger-mode refers to these additional dates as
_effective_ dates.  To set the effective date of a transaction, place
the point in the first line of a transaction and type ‘C-c C-t’.  The
effective date will be added to the transaction.  To set the effective
date for an individual posting, place point in the posting and type ‘C-c
C-t’ and the effective date for that posting will be added at the end of
the posting.


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Quick Balance Display,  Prev: Setting a Transactions Effective Date,  Up: Adding Transactions

2.2.2 Quick Balance Display
---------------------------

You will often want to quickly check the balance of an account.  The
easiest way is to position point on the account you are interested in,
and type ‘C-c C-p’.  The Minibuffer will ask you to verify the name of
the account you want, if it is already correct hit ‘RET’, then the
balance of the account will be displayed in the Minibuffer.


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Copying Transactions,  Next: Editing Amounts,  Prev: Adding Transactions,  Up: The Ledger Buffer

2.3 Copying Transactions
========================

An easy way to copy a transaction is to type ‘C-c C-k’ or menu entry
‘Copy Trans at Point’.  You will be prompted the new date for the copied
transaction, and after having confirmed with ‘RET’, new transaction will
be inserted at _date_ position in buffer.

   If you prefer to keep blank lines between your transactions, you can
change the default in ‘ledger-copy-transaction-insert-blank-line-after’.


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Editing Amounts,  Next: Marking Transactions,  Prev: Copying Transactions,  Up: The Ledger Buffer

2.4 Editing Amounts
===================

GNU Emacs Calculator, aka ‘Calc’, is a very powerful Reverse Polish
Notation calculator built into all recent version of Emacs.  Ledger-mode
makes it easy to calculate values for amount by integrating ‘Calc’.
With the point anywhere in the same line as a posting, typing ‘C-c C-b’
will bring up the ‘Calc’ buffer, and push the current amount for the
posting onto the top of the ‘Calc’ stack.  Perform any calculations you
need to arrive at the final value, then type ‘y’ to yank the value at
the top of stack back into the ledger buffer.  Note: ‘Calc’ does not
directly support commas as decimal separators.  Ledger-mode will
translate values from decimal-comma format to decimal-period format for
use in ‘Calc’, but it cannot intercept the value being yanked from the
‘Calc’ stack, so decimal-comma users will have to manually replace the
period with a comma.


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Marking Transactions,  Next: Formatting Transactions,  Prev: Editing Amounts,  Up: The Ledger Buffer

2.5 Marking Transactions
========================

Ledger considers transaction or posting to be in one of three states:
uncleared, cleared, and pending.  For calculation Ledger ignores these
states unless specifically instructed to use them.  Ledger-mode assigns
some additional meaning to the states:

   • Uncleared.  No state.  This is equivalent to sticking a check in
     the mail.  It has been obligated, but not been cashed by the
     recipient.  It could also apply to credit/debit card transactions
     that have not been cleared into your account balance.  You bank may
     call these transactions _pending_, but Ledger-mode uses a slightly
     different meaning.

   • Pending.  Ledger-mode’s reconciliation function see pending
     transactions as an intermediate step in reconciling an account.
     When doing a reconciliation (*note Reconciliation::), marking a
     transaction as pending means that you have seen the transaction
     finally recorded by the recipient, but you have not completely
     reconciled the account.

   • Cleared.  The transaction has been completely recognized by all
     parties to the transaction.

   Typing ‘C-c C-c’, depending where is the point, will clear the
complete transaction, or an individual posting.  This places an asterisk
‘*’ prior to the payee for the complete transaction, or prior to the
account for an individual posting.  When point is inside a transaction,
specifically on an individual posting, you can still clear the complete
transaction by typing ‘C-c C-e’.


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Formatting Transactions,  Next: Deleting Transactions,  Prev: Marking Transactions,  Up: The Ledger Buffer

2.6 Formatting Transactions
===========================

When editing a transaction, liberal use of the ‘TAB’ key can keep the
transaction well formatted.  If you want to have Ledger-mode cleanup the
formatting of a transaction you can use ‘Align Transaction’ or ‘Align
Region’ from the menu bar.

   The menu item ‘Clean-up Buffer’ sorts all transactions in the buffer
by date, removes extraneous empty lines and aligns every transaction.


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Deleting Transactions,  Next: Sorting Transactions,  Prev: Formatting Transactions,  Up: The Ledger Buffer

2.7 Deleting Transactions
=========================

Along with normal buffer editing methods to delete text, Ledger-mode
provides an easy way to delete the transaction under point: ‘C-c C-d’.
The advantage to using this method is that the complete transaction
operation is in the undo buffer.


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Sorting Transactions,  Next: Narrowing Transactions,  Prev: Deleting Transactions,  Up: The Ledger Buffer

2.8 Sorting Transactions
========================

As you operating on the Ledger files, they may become disorganized.  For
the most part, Ledger doesn’t care, but our human brains prefer a bit of
order.  Sorting the transactions in a buffer into chronological order
can help bring order to chaos.  Either using ‘Sort Region’ menu entry or
typing ‘C-c C-s’ will sort all of the transactions in a region by date.
Ledger-mode isn’t particularly smart about handling dates and it simply
sorts the transactions using the string at the beginning of the
transaction.  So, you should use the preferred ISO 8601 standard date
format ‘YYYY/MM/DD’ which easily sorts.

   Note, there is a menu entry ‘Sort Buffer’ to sort the entire buffer.
Special transactions like automated transaction, will be moved in the
sorting process and may not function correctly afterwards.  For this
reason there is no key sequence.

   You can limit the allowed sort region by using embedded Ledger-mode
markup within your ledger.  For example:

     <<< information to not sort >>>

     ; Ledger-mode: Start sort

     <<< transactions to sort >>>

     ; Ledger-mode: End sort

     <<< information to not sort >>>

   You can use menu entries ‘Mark Sort Beginning’ to insert start and
‘Mark Sort End’ to insert end markers.  These functions will
automatically delete old markers and put new marker at point.


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Narrowing Transactions,  Prev: Sorting Transactions,  Up: The Ledger Buffer

2.9 Narrowing Transactions
==========================

Often you will want to run Ledger register reports just to look at a
specific set of transactions.  If you don’t need the running total
calculation handled by Ledger, Ledger-mode provides a rapid way of
narrowing what is displayed in the buffer in a way that is simpler than
the Ledger register command.

   Based on the Emacs Occur mode by Alexey Veretennikov, Ledger-occur
hides all transactions that do _not_ meet a specific regular expression.
The regular expression can match on any part of the transaction.  If you
want to find all transactions whose amount ends in ‘.37’, you can do
that (I don’t know why, but hey, whatever ever floats you aerostat).

   Using ‘C-c C-f’ or the ‘Narrow to Regex’ menu entry, enter a regular
expression in the Minibuffer.  Ledger-mode will hide all other
transactions.  For details of the regular expression syntax, see your
Emacs documentation.  A few examples using the ‘demo.ledger’ are given
here:

‘Groceries’
     Show only transactions that have a posting to the ‘Groceries’
     account.

‘^2011/01’
     Show only transactions occurring in January of 2011.

‘^2011/.*/25’
     Show only transactions occurring on the 25th of the month in 2011.

‘auto’
     Show only transactions with payees or accounts or comments
     containing.  ‘auto’

‘harley$’
     Show only transactions with any line ending with ‘harley’.

   To show back all transactions simply invoke ‘Narrow to Regex’ or ‘C-c
C-f’ again.

   If you’ve edited some transactions after narrowing such that they
would no longer match the regular expression, you can refresh the
narrowed view using ‘C-c C-g’.

3.1 Basics of Reconciliation
============================

Even in this relatively modern era, financial transactions do not happen
instantaneously, unless you are paying cash.  When you swipe your debit
card the money may take several days to actually come out of your
account, or a check may take several days to _clear_.  That is the root
of the difference between _obligating_ funds and _expending_ funds.
Obligation says you have agreed to pay it, the expenditure doesn’t
happen until the money actually leaves your account.  Or in the case of
receiving payment, you have an account receivable until the money has
actually made it to you.

   After an account has been reconciled you have verified that all the
transactions in that account have been correctly recorded and all
parties agree.


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Starting a Reconciliation,  Next: Mark Transactions Pending,  Prev: Basics of Reconciliation,  Up: The Reconcile Buffer

3.2 Starting a Reconciliation
=============================

To start reconciling an account you must have a target, both the
transactions that you know about and the transactions the bank knows
about.  You can get this from a monthly statement, or from checking your
on-line transaction history.  It also helps immensely to know the final
cleared balance you are aiming for.

   Use menu ‘Reconcile Account’ or keyboard shortcut ‘C-c C-r’ to start
reconciliation.

   If cursor is on an account, Ledger-mode will propose this account, or
in the Minibuffer, will prompt for an account to reconcile.  Hit ‘RET’
if you are happy with proposed account, or enter ‘Checking’ as example.
Ledger-mode is not particular about what you enter for the account.  You
can leave it blank and ‘*Reconcile*’ buffer will show you _all_
uncleared transactions.

   After you enter the account enter the target amount.  It is helpful
to enter an amount with a commodity.  You can also leave it blank, you
will be able to clear transactions but not benefit from balance
calculations.  It assumes initially that you are using ‘$’ (USD) as your
default commodity.  If you are working in a different currency you can
change the default in variable ‘ledger-reconcile-default-commodity’ to
whatever you need.  If you work in multiple commodities simply enter the
commoditized amount (for example ‘340 VSDX’, for 340 shares of VSDX).

   Ledger-mode reconcile cannot currently reconcile accounts that have
multiple commodities, such as brokerage accounts.  You may use
reconciliation mode to clear transactions, but balance calculations will
not display the complete list of commodities.


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Mark Transactions Pending,  Next: Edit Transactions During Reconciliation,  Prev: Starting a Reconciliation,  Up: The Reconcile Buffer

3.3 Mark Transactions Pending
=============================

The ‘*Reconcile*’ buffer will show all the uncleared transactions that
meet the criteria set in the regex.  By default uncleared transactions
are shown in red.  When you have verified that a transaction has been
correctly and completely recorded by the opposing party, mark the
transaction as pending using the ‘SPC’ bar.  Continue this process until
you agree with the opposing party and the difference from your target is
zero.

3.4 Edit Transactions during Reconciliation
===========================================

If you find errors during reconciliation.  You can visit the transaction
under point in the ‘*Reconcile*’ buffer by hitting the ‘RET’ key.  This
will take you to the transaction in the Ledger buffer.  When you have
finished editing the transaction, saving the buffer will automatically
return you to the ‘*Reconcile*’ buffer and you can mark the transaction
if appropriate.


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Finalize Reconciliation,  Next: Adding and Deleting Transactions during Reconciliation,  Prev: Edit Transactions During Reconciliation,  Up: The Reconcile Buffer

3.5 Finalize Reconciliation
===========================

Once you have marked all transactions as pending and the cleared balance
is correct.  Finish the reconciliation by typing ‘C-c C-c’.  This marks
all pending transactions as cleared and saves the ledger buffer.

   Type ‘q’ to close out the reconciliation buffer.  If variable
LEDGER-RECONCILE-FINISH-FORCE-QUIT is set, the reconciliation buffer
will be killed automatically after ‘C-c C-c’.

3.6 Adding and Deleting Transactions during Reconciliation
==========================================================

While reconciling, you may find new transactions that need to be entered
into your ledger.  Simply type ‘a’ to bring up the quick add for the
ledger buffer.

   Typing ‘d’ will delete the transaction under point in the
‘*Reconcile*’ buffer from the ledger buffer.

3.7 Changing Reconciliation Account
===================================

You can conveniently switch the account being reconciled by typing ‘g’,
and entering a new account to reconcile.  This simply restarts the
reconcile process.  Any transactions that were marked _pending_ in the
ledger buffer are left in that state when the account is switched.

4.1 Running Reports
===================

The real power behind Ledger is in its amazing reporting capability.
Ledger-mode provides easy facility to run reports directly from Emacs.
It has four reports built-in and facilities for adding custom reports.

   Typing ‘C-c C-o C-r’ or using menu ‘Run Report’ prompts for the name
of a saved report.  The built-in reports are:

BAL
     Produce a balance reports of all accounts.

REG
     Produce a register report of all transactions.

PAYEE
     Prompt for a payee, then produce a register report of all
     transactions involving that payee.

ACCOUNT
     Prompt for an account, then produce a register report of all
     transactions involving that account.

   While viewing reports you can easily switch back and forth between
the ledger buffer and the ‘*Ledger Report*’ buffer.  In ‘*Ledger
Report*’ buffer, typing ‘RET’ will take you to that transaction in the
ledger buffer.  While in the ledger buffer ‘C-c C-o C-g’ returns you to
the ‘*Ledger Report*’ buffer.

   By default Ledger-mode will refresh the report buffer when the ledger
buffer is saved.  If you want to rerun the report at another time ‘C-c
C-o C-a’.  This is useful if you have other programs altering your
ledger file outside of Emacs.


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Adding and Editing Reports,  Next: Reversing Report Order,  Prev: Running Basic Reports,  Up: The Report Buffer

4.2 Adding and Editing Reports
==============================

* Menu:

* Expansion Formats::
* Make Report Transactions Active::

If you type a report name that Ledger-mode doesn’t recognize it will
prompt you for a ledger command line to run.  That command is
automatically saved with the name given and you can re-run it at any
time.

   There are two ways to edit the command line for a report.  The first
is to provide a prefix argument to the run-report command.  For example,
type ‘M-1 C-c C-o C-r’.  This will prompt you for the report name, then
present the report command line to be edited.  When you hit ‘RET’, the
report will be run, but it will not be permanently saved.  If you want
to save it, type ‘S’ in the ‘*Ledger Report*’ buffer you will have the
option to give it a new name, or overwrite the old report.

   Deleting reports is accomplished by typing ‘C-c C-o C-e’ or using
‘Edit Report’ menu in the ledger buffer, or typing ‘e’ in the ‘*Ledger
Report*’ buffer.  This takes you to the Emacs customization window for
the Ledger Reports variables.  Use the widgets to delete the report you
want removed.

   Typing ‘C-c C-o C-s’ will prompt for a name and save the current
report.


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Expansion Formats,  Next: Make Report Transactions Active,  Prev: Adding and Editing Reports,  Up: Adding and Editing Reports

4.2.1 Expansion Formats
-----------------------

It is sometimes convenient to leave room to customize a report without
saving the command line every time.  For example running a register
report for a specific account entered at runtime by the user.  The
built-in report ACCOUNT does exactly that, using a variable expansion to
prompt the user for the account to use.  There are four variables that
can be expanded to run a report:

LEDGER-FILE
     Returns the file to be operated on.

PAYEE
     Prompts for a payee.

ACCOUNT
     Prompt for an account.

TAGNAME
     Prompt for a meta-data tag name.

TAGVALUE
     Prompt for a meta-data tag value.

MONTH
     Return the current month.

   You can use these expansion values in your ledger report commands.
For example, if you wanted to specify a register report the displayed
transactions from a user-determined account with a particular meta-data
tag value, you specify the following command line:

     ledger -f %(ledger-file) reg %(account) \
       --limit \"tag('my-tag') =~/%(value)/\"

   Note how the double-quotes are escaped with back-slashes.

   Additionally, if you want a report showing a particular month and be
able to easily change that month, you can specify a period using the
‘%(month)’ specifier like this:

     ledger -f %(ledger-file) balance --period %(month) ^Income ^Expenses

   When you do this, you can use ‘M-p’ or ‘M-n’ to re-open the same
report with the previous or next month.

4.2.2 Make Report Transactions Active
-------------------------------------

In a large register report it is convenient to be able to jump to the
source transaction.  Ledger-mode will automatically include source
information in every register file that doesn’t contain a ‘--subtotal’
option.  It does this by adding
‘--prepend-format='%(filename):%(beg_line):'’ to the register report
command-line you specify.  You should never have to see this, but if
there is an error in your ledger output this additional information may
not get stripped out of the visible report.

4.3 Reversing Report Order
==========================

Often, banks show their on-line transaction histories with the most
recent transaction at the top.  Ledger itself cannot do a sensible
ledger report in reverse chronological order, if you sort on reverse
date the calculation will also run in the opposite direction.  If you
want to compare a ledger register report to a bank report with the most
recent transactions at the top, type ‘R’ in the ‘*Ledger Report*’ buffer
and it will reverse the order of the transactions and maintain the
proper mathematical sense.

5 Scheduling Transactions
*************************

The Ledger program provides for automating transactions but these
transaction aren’t _real_, they only exist inside a ledger session and
are not reflected in the actual data file.  Many transactions are very
repetitive, but may vary slightly in the date they occur on, or the
amount.  Some transactions are weekly, monthly, quarterly or annually.
Ledger mode provides a way to schedule upcoming transaction with a
flexible scheduler that allows you to specify the transactions in a
separate ledger file and calculate the upcoming occurrences of those
transactions.  You can then copy the transactions into your live data
file.

* Menu:

* Specifying Upcoming Transactions::


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Specifying Upcoming Transactions,  Prev: Scheduling Transactions,  Up: Scheduling Transactions

5.1 Specifying Upcoming Transactions
====================================

The format for specifying transactions is identical to Ledger’s file
format with the exception of the date field.  The data field is modified
by surrounding it with brackets and using wild cards and special
characters to specify when the transactions should appear.

* Menu:

* Transactions that occur on specific dates::
* Transactions that occur on specific days::


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Transactions that occur on specific dates,  Next: Transactions that occur on specific days,  Prev: Specifying Upcoming Transactions,  Up: Specifying Upcoming Transactions

5.1.1 Transactions that occur on specific dates
-----------------------------------------------

Many times you will enter repetitive transactions that occur on the same
day of the month each month.  These can be specified using a wild card
in the year and month with a fixed date in the day.  The following entry
specifies a transaction that occurs on the first and fifteenth of every
month in every year.
     [*/*/1,15] Paycheck
         Income:Job       $1000.00
         Assets:Checking

   Some transactions do not occur every month.  Comma separated lists of
the months, or ‘E’ for even, or ‘O’ for odd number months can also be
specified.  The following entry specifies a bi-monthly exterminator bill
that occurs in the even months:
     [*/E/01]  Exterminator
         Expenses:Home   $100.00
         Assets:Checking


File: ledger-mode.info,  Node: Transactions that occur on specific days,  Prev: Transactions that occur on specific dates,  Up: Specifying Upcoming Transactions

5.1.2 Transactions that occur on specific days
----------------------------------------------

Some transactions occur every relative to the day of the week rather
than the date of the month.  For example, many people are paid every two
weeks without regard to the day of the month.  Other events may occur on
specific days regardless of the date.  For example the following
transactions creates a transaction every other Thursday:

     [2014/11/27+2Th]  Paycheck
         Income:Job       $1000.00
         Assets:Checking

   It is necessary to specify a starting date in order for this type of
recurrence relation to be specified.  The day names are two character
codes that default to Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa, Su, for Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday respectively.  You can
change the codes to something more convenient for your locale by
customizing the ledger ‘ledger-schedule-week-days’.  They must be two
characters long.
