Get the original version in the header of LIBRARY.

The original version is stored in the X-Original-Version header.
This header is added by the MELPA package archive to preserve
upstream version numbers.

LIBRARY is either a symbol denoting a named feature, or a library
name as string.

If SHOW is non-nil, show the version in the minibuffer.

Return the version from the header of LIBRARY as list.  Signal an
error if the LIBRARY was not found or had no X-Original-Version
header.

See Info node `(elisp)Library Headers' for more information
about library headers.

If SHOW is non-nil, show the version in the minibuffer.

Return the version from the header of LIBRARY as list.  Signal an

Get the original version of the library defining FUNCTION.

The original version is stored in the X-Original-Version header.
This header is added by the MELPA package archive to preserve
upstream version numbers.

If SHOW is non-nil, show the version in mini-buffer.

This function is mainly intended to find the version of a major
or minor mode, i.e.

   (pkg-info-defining-library-version 'flycheck-mode)

Return the version of the library defining FUNCTION.  Signal an
error if FUNCTION is not a valid function, if its defining
library was not found, or if the library had no proper version
header.

Get the version of an installed PACKAGE.

If SHOW is non-nil, show the version in the minibuffer.

Return the version as list, or nil if PACKAGE is not installed.

(autoload 'pkg-info-version-info "pkg-info" "\
Obtain complete version info for LIBRARY and PACKAGE.

LIBRARY is a symbol denoting a named feature, or a library name
as string.  PACKAGE is a symbol denoting an ELPA package.  If
omitted or nil, default to LIBRARY.

If SHOW is non-nil, show the version in the minibuffer.

When called interactively, prompt for LIBRARY.  When called
interactively with prefix argument, prompt for PACKAGE as well.

Return a string with complete version information for LIBRARY.
This version information contains the version from the headers of
LIBRARY, and the version of the installed PACKAGE, the LIBRARY is
part of.  If PACKAGE is not installed, or if the PACKAGE version
is the same as the LIBRARY version, do not include a package
version.
