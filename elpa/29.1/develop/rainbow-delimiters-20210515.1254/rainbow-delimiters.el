;;; Installation:

;; The recommended way is to use MELPA (http://melpa.org/) or MELPA Stable
;; (http://stable.melpa.org/). If either is in your `package-archives', do
;;   M-x package-install RET rainbow-delimiters RET
;; Otherwise, open `rainbow-delimiters.el' in Emacs and use
;;   M-x package-install-from-buffer
;; Any other methods of installation are unsupported.

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Rainbow-delimiters is a "rainbow parentheses"-like mode which highlights
;; parentheses, brackets, and braces according to their depth. Each
;; successive level is highlighted in a different color. This makes it easy
;; to spot matching delimiters, orient yourself in the code, and tell which
;; statements are at a given level.
;;
;; Great care has been taken to make this mode fast. You shouldn't see
;; any discernible change in scrolling or editing speed while using it,
;; even in delimiter-rich languages like Clojure, Lisp, and Scheme.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; To toggle the mode in the current buffer:
;;   M-x rainbow-delimiters-mode
;; To start the mode automatically in `foo-mode', add the following to your init
;; file:
;;   (add-hook 'foo-mode-hook #'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
;; To start the mode automatically in most programming modes (Emacs 24 and
;; above):
;;   (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
;;
;; Customization:
;;
;; To customize various options, including the color theme:
;;   M-x customize-group rainbow-delimiters
;;
;; You can specify custom colors by customizing following faces:
;; - Faces take the form `rainbow-delimiters-depth-N-face', with N being the
;;   depth. Depth begins at 1, the outermost color. Faces exist for depths 1-9.
;; - The unmatched delimiter face: `rainbow-delimiters-unmatched-face'.
;; - The mismatched delimiter face: `rainbow-delimiters-mismatched-face'.
