With-Editor User Manual
***********************

The library ‘with-editor’ makes it easy to use the Emacsclient as the
‘$EDITOR’ of child processes, making sure they know how to call home.
For remote processes a substitute is provided, which communicates with
Emacs on standard output instead of using a socket as the Emacsclient
does.

   This library was written because Magit has to be able to do the above
to allow the user to edit commit messages gracefully and to edit rebase
sequences, which wouldn’t be possible at all otherwise.

   Because other packages can benefit from such functionality, this
library is made available as a separate package.  It also defines some
additional functionality which makes it useful even for end-users, who
don’t use Magit or another package which uses it internally.

This manual is for With-Editor version 3.3.2.

1 Using the With-Editor package
*******************************

The ‘With-Editor’ package is used internally by Magit when editing
commit messages and rebase sequences.  It also provides some commands
and features which are useful by themselves, even if you don’t use
Magit.

   For information about using this library in you own package, see
*note Using With-Editor as a library::.

1.1 Configuring With-Editor
===========================

With-Editor tries very hard to locate a suitable ‘emacsclient’
executable, so ideally you should never have to customize the option
‘with-editor-emacsclient-executable’.  When it fails to do so, then the
most likely reason is that someone found yet another way to package
Emacs (most likely on macOS) without putting the executable on ‘$PATH’,
and we have to add another kludge to find it anyway.

 -- User Option: with-editor-emacsclient-executable
     The ‘emacsclient’ executable used as the editor by child process of
     this Emacs instance.  By using this executable, child processes can
     call home to their parent process.

     This option is automatically set at startup by looking in
     ‘exec-path’, and other places where the executable could be
     installed, to find the ‘emacsclient’ executable most suitable for
     the current Emacs instance.

     You should *not* customize this option permanently.  If you have to
     do it, then you should consider that a temporary kludge and inform
     the Magit maintainer as described in *note Debugging::.

     If With-Editor fails to find a suitable ‘emacsclient’ on you
     system, then this should be fixed for all users at once, by
     teaching ‘with-editor-locate-emacsclient’ how to do so on your
     system and system like yours.  Doing it this way has the advantage,
     that you won’t have do it again every time you update Emacs, and
     that other users who have installed Emacs the same way as you have,
     won’t have to go through the same trouble.

     Note that there also is a nuclear option; setting this variable to
     ‘nil’ causes the "sleeping editor" described below to be used even
     for local child processes.  Obviously we don’t recommend that you
     use this except in "emergencies", i.e., before we had a change to
     add a kludge appropriate for you setup.

 -- Function: with-editor-locate-emacsclient
     The function used to set the initial value of the option
     ‘with-editor-emacsclient-executable’.  There’s a lot of voodoo
     here.

   The ‘emacsclient’ cannot be used when using Tramp to run a process on
a remote machine.  (Theoretically it could, but that would be hard to
setup, very fragile, and rather insecure).

   With-Editor provides an alternative "editor" which can be used by
remote processes in much the same way as local processes use an
‘emacsclient’ executable.  This alternative is known as the "sleeping
editor" because it is implemented as a shell script which sleeps until
it receives a signal.

 -- User Option: with-editor-sleeping-editor
     The sleeping editor is a shell script used as the editor of child
     processes when the ‘emacsclient’ executable cannot be used.

     This fallback is used for asynchronous process started inside the
     macro ‘with-editor’, when the process runs on a remote machine or
     for local processes when ‘with-editor-emacsclient-executable’ is
     ‘nil’.

     Where the latter uses a socket to communicate with Emacs’ server,
     this substitute prints edit requests to its standard output on
     which a process filter listens for such requests.  As such it is
     not a complete substitute for a proper ‘emacsclient’, it can only
     be used as ‘$EDITOR’ of child process of the current Emacs
     instance.

     Some shells do not execute traps immediately when waiting for a
     child process, but by default we do use such a blocking child
     process.

     If you use such a shell (e.g., ‘csh’ on FreeBSD, but not Debian),
     then you have to edit this option.  You can either replace ‘sh’
     with ‘bash’ (and install that), or you can use the older, less
     performant implementation:

          "sh -c '\
          echo \"WITH-EDITOR: $$ OPEN $0$1 IN $(pwd)\"; \
          trap \"exit 0\" USR1; \
          trap \"exit 1\" USR2; \
          while true; do sleep 1; done'"

     Note that the unit separator character () right after the file name
     ($0) is required.

     Also note that using this alternative implementation leads to a
     delay of up to a second.  The delay can be shortened by replacing
     ‘sleep 1’ with ‘sleep 0.01’, or if your implementation does not
     support floats, then by using ‘nanosleep’ instead.

1.2 Using With-Editor commands
==============================

This section describes how to use the ‘with-editor’ library _outside_ of
Magit.  You don’t need to know any of this just to create commits using
Magit.

   The commands ‘with-editor-async-shell-command’ and
‘with-editor-shell-command’ are intended as drop in replacements for
‘async-shell-command’ and ‘shell-command’.  They automatically export
‘$EDITOR’ making sure the executed command uses the current Emacs
instance as "the editor".  With a prefix argument these commands prompt
for an alternative environment variable such as ‘$GIT_EDITOR’.

 -- Command: with-editor-async-shell-command
     This command is like ‘async-shell-command’, but it runs the shell
     command with the current Emacs instance exported as ‘$EDITOR’.

 -- Command: with-editor-shell-command
     This command is like ‘shell-command’, but if the shell command ends
     with ‘&’ and is therefore run asynchronously, then the current
     Emacs instance is exported as ‘$EDITOR’.

   To always use these variants add this to you init file:

     (keymap-global-set "<remap> <async-shell-command>"
                        #'with-editor-async-shell-command)
     (keymap-global-set "<remap> <shell-command>"
                        #'with-editor-shell-command)

   Alternatively use the global ‘shell-command-with-editor-mode’.

 -- Variable: shell-command-with-editor-mode
     When this mode is active, then ‘$EDITOR’ is exported whenever
     ultimately ‘shell-command’ is called to asynchronously run some
     shell command.  This affects most variants of that command, whether
     they are defined in Emacs or in some third-party package.

   The command ‘with-editor-export-editor’ exports ‘$EDITOR’ or another
such environment variable in ‘shell-mode’, ‘eshell-mode’, ‘term-mode’
and ‘vterm-mode’ buffers.  Use this Emacs command before executing a
shell command which needs the editor set, or always arrange for the
current Emacs instance to be used as editor by adding it to the
appropriate mode hooks:

     (add-hook 'shell-mode-hook  'with-editor-export-editor)
     (add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook 'with-editor-export-editor)
     (add-hook 'term-exec-hook   'with-editor-export-editor)
     (add-hook 'vterm-mode-hook  'with-editor-export-editor)

   Some variants of this function exist; these two forms are equivalent:

     (add-hook 'shell-mode-hook
               (apply-partially 'with-editor-export-editor "GIT_EDITOR"))
     (add-hook 'shell-mode-hook 'with-editor-export-git-editor)

 -- Command: with-editor-export-editor
     When invoked in a ‘shell-mode’, ‘eshell-mode’, ‘term-mode’ or
     ‘vterm-mode’ buffer, this command teaches shell commands to use the
     current Emacs instance as the editor, by exporting ‘$EDITOR’.

 -- Command: with-editor-export-git-editor
     This command is like ‘with-editor-export-editor’ but exports
     ‘$GIT_EDITOR’.

 -- Command: with-editor-export-hg-editor
     This command is like ‘with-editor-export-editor’ but exports
     ‘$HG_EDITOR’.

2 Using With-Editor as a library
********************************

This section describes how to use the ‘with-editor’ library _outside_ of
Magit to teach another package how to have its child processes call
home, just like Magit does.  You don’t need to know any of this just to
create commits using Magit.  You can also ignore this if you use
‘with-editor’ outside of Magit, but only as an end-user.

   For information about interactive use and options that affect both
interactive and non-interactive use, see *note Using the With-Editor
package::.

 -- Macro: with-editor &rest body
     This macro arranges for the ‘emacsclient’ or the sleeping editor to
     be used as the editor of child processes, effectively teaching them
     to call home to the current Emacs instance when they require that
     the user edits a file.

     This is done by establishing a local binding for
     ‘process-environment’ and changing the value of the ‘EDITOR’
     environment variable in that scope.  This affects all
     (asynchronous) processes started by forms (dynamically) inside
     BODY.

     If BODY begins with a literal string, then that variable is set
     instead of ‘EDITOR’.

 -- Macro: with-editor envvar &rest body
     This macro is like ‘with-editor’ instead that the ENVVAR argument
     is required and that it is evaluated at run-time.

 -- Function: with-editor-set-process-filter process filter
     This function is like ‘set-process-filter’ but ensures that adding
     the new FILTER does not remove the ‘with-editor-process-filter’.
     This is done by wrapping the two filter functions using a lambda,
     which becomes the actual filter.  It calls FILTER first, which may
     or may not insert the text into the PROCESS’s buffer.  Then it
     calls ‘with-editor-process-filter’, passing t as
     NO-STANDARD-FILTER.

3 Debugging
***********

With-Editor tries very hard to locate a suitable ‘emacsclient’
executable, and then sets option ‘with-editor-emacsclient-executable’
accordingly.  In very rare cases this fails.  When it does fail, then
the most likely reason is that someone found yet another way to package
Emacs (most likely on macOS) without putting the executable on ‘$PATH’,
and we have to add another kludge to find it anyway.

   If you are having problems using ‘with-editor’, e.g., you cannot
commit in Magit, then please open a new issue at
<https://github.com/magit/with-editor/issues> and provide information
about your Emacs installation.  Most importantly how did you install
Emacs and what is the output of ‘M-x with-editor-debug RET’.
