Whether to add Forge's bindings to various Magit keymaps.

If you want to disable this, then you must set this to nil before
`magit' is loaded.  If you do it before `forge' but after `magit'
is loaded, then `magit-mode-map' ends up being modified anyway.

If this is nil, then `forge-toggle-display-in-status-buffer' can
no longer do its job.  It might be better to set the global value
of `forge-display-in-status-buffer' to nil instead.  That way you
can still display topics on demand in the status buffer.")
