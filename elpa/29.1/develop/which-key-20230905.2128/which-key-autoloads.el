(defvar which-key-mode nil "\
Non-nil if Which-Key mode is enabled.
See the `which-key-mode' command
for a description of this minor mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')
or call the function `which-key-mode'.")

Toggle which-key-mode.

This is a global minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Which-Key mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive,
enable the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `(default-value \\='which-key-mode)'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.

Replace the description of KEY using REPLACEMENT in KEYMAP.
KEY should take a format suitable for use in `kbd'. REPLACEMENT
should be a cons cell of the form (STRING . COMMAND) for each
REPLACEMENT, where STRING is the replacement string and COMMAND
is a symbol corresponding to the intended command to be
replaced. COMMAND can be nil if the binding corresponds to a key
prefix. An example is

(which-key-add-keymap-based-replacements global-map
  \"C-x w\" \\='(\"Save as\" . write-file)).

For backwards compatibility, REPLACEMENT can also be a string,
but the above format is preferred, and the option to use a string
for REPLACEMENT will eventually be removed.

KEY-SEQUENCE is a string suitable for use in `kbd'. REPLACEMENT
may either be a string, as in

a cons of two strings as in

(which-key-add-key-based-replacements \"C-x 8\"
                                        \\='(\"unicode\" . \"Unicode keys\"))

replacement.

name for the keys under a prefix.
