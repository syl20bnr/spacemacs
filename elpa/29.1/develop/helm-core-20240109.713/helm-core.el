** Basics

To navigate in this Help buffer see [[Helm help][here]].

Helm narrows down the list of candidates as you type a filter
pattern.  See [[Matching in Helm][Matching in Helm]].

Helm accepts multiple space-separated patterns, each pattern can
be negated with \"!\".

Helm also supports fuzzy matching in some places when specified,
you will find several variables to enable fuzzy matching in
diverse [[Helm sources][sources]], see [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki/Fuzzy-matching][fuzzy-matching]] in helm-wiki for more infos.

Helm generally uses familiar Emacs keys to navigate the list.
Here follow some of the less obvious bindings:

- `\\<helm-map>\\[helm-maybe-exit-minibuffer]' selects the
candidate from the list, executes the default action upon exiting
the Helm session.

- `\\<helm-map>\\[helm-execute-persistent-action]' executes the
default action but without exiting the Helm session.  Not all
sources support this.

- `\\<helm-map>\\[helm-select-action]' displays a list of actions
available on current candidate or all marked candidates.  The
default binding <tab> is ordinarily used for completion, but that
would be redundant since Helm completes upon every character
entered in the prompt.  See [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki#helm-completion-vs-emacs-completion][Helm wiki]].

Note: In addition to the default actions list, additional actions
appear depending on the type of the selected candidate(s).  They
are called filtered actions.

** Helm sources

Helm uses what's called sources to provide different kinds of
completions.  Each Helm session can handle one or more source.  A
source is an alist object which is build from various classes,
see [[Writing your own Helm sources][here]] and [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki/Developing#creating-a-source][Helm wiki]] for more infos.

*** Configure sources

You will find in Helm sources already built and bound to a
variable called generally `helm-source-<something>'.  In this case
it is an alist and you can change the attributes (keys) values
using `helm-set-attr' function in your configuration.  Of course
you have to ensure before calling `helm-set-attr' that the file
containing source is loaded, e.g. with `with-eval-after-load'.  Of
course you can also completely redefine the source but this is
generally not elegant as it duplicate for its most part code
already defined in Helm.

You will find also sources that are not built and even not bound
to any variables because they are rebuilded at each start of a
Helm session.  In this case you can add a defmethod called
`helm-setup-user-source' to your config:

#+begin_src elisp

    (cl-defmethod helm-setup-user-source ((source helm-moccur-class))
      (setf (slot-value source 'follow) -1))

#+end_src

See
[[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki/FAQ#why-is-a-customizable-helm-source-nil][here]]
for more infos, and for more complex examples of configuration
[[https://github.com/thierryvolpiatto/emacs-tv-config/blob/master/init-helm.el#L340][here]].

** Modify keybindings in Helm

Helm main keymap is `helm-map', all keys bound in this map apply
to all Helm sources.  However, most sources have their own keymap,
with each binding overriding its counterpart in `helm-map', you
can see all bindings in effect in the [[Commands][Commands]]
section (available only if the source has its own keymap and
documentation of course).

** Matching in Helm

All that you write in minibuffer is interpreted as a regexp or
multiple regexps if separated by a space.  This is true for most
sources unless the developer of the source has disabled it or
have choosen to use fuzzy matching.  Even if a source has fuzzy
matching enabled, Helm will switch to multi match as soon as it
detects a space in the pattern.  It may also switch to multi match
as well if pattern starts with a \"^\" beginning of line sign.  In
those cases each pattern separated with space should be a regexp
and not a fuzzy pattern.  When using multi match patterns, each
pattern starting with \"!\" is interpreted as a negation i.e.
match everything but this.

*** Completion-styles

UPDATE: At version 3.8.0 Helm default is now to NOT use
`completion-styles' i.e. now `helm-completion-style' default to
'helm and no more to 'emacs.

If you want to use `completion-styles' in Helm customize
`helm-completion-style' to 'emacs.

Helm generally fetches its candidates with the :candidates
function up to `helm-candidate-number-limit' and then applies
match functions to these candidates according to `helm-pattern'.
But Helm allows matching candidates directly from the :candidates
function using its own `completion-styles'.
Helm provides 'helm completion style but also 'helm-flex
completion style for Emacs<27 that don't have 'flex completion
style, otherwise (emacs-27) 'flex completion style is used to
provide fuzzy aka flex completion.

When using helm-fuzzy as `helm-completion-style' helm use its own
fuzzy implementation which have nothing to do with emacs `flex'
style.

Any Helm sources can use `completion-styles'
by using :match-dynamic slot and building their :candidates
function with `helm-dynamic-completion'.

Example:

#+begin_src elisp

    (helm :sources (helm-build-sync-source \"test\"
                     :candidates (helm-dynamic-completion
                                  '(foo bar baz foab)
                                  'symbolp)
                     :match-dynamic t)
          :buffer \"*helm test*\")

#+end_src

By default Helm sets up `completion-styles' and always adds 'helm
to it.  However the flex completion styles are not added.  This is
up to the user if she wants to have such completion to enable
this.
As specified above use 'flex for emacs-27 and 'helm-flex for
emacs-26. Anyway, 'helm-flex is not provided in
`completion-styles-alist' if 'flex is present.

Finally Helm provides two user variables to control
`completion-styles' usage: `helm-completion-style' and
`helm-completion-styles-alist'.  Both variables are customizable.
The former allows retrieving previous Helm behavior if needed, by
setting it to `helm' or `helm-fuzzy', default being `emacs' which
allows dynamic completion and usage of `completion-styles'.  The
second allows setting `helm-completion-style' per mode and also
specifying `completion-styles' per mode (see its docstring).  Note
that these two variables take effect only in helm-mode i.e. in
all that uses `completion-read' or `completion-in-region', IOW all
helmized commands.  File completion in `read-file-name' family
doesn't obey completion-styles and has its own file completion
implementation. Native Helm commands using `completion-styles'
doesn't obey `helm-completion-style' and
`helm-completion-styles-alist' (e.g., helm-M-x).

Also for a better control of styles in native Helm sources (not
helmized by helm-mode) using :match-dynamic,
`helm-dynamic-completion' provides a STYLES argument that allows
specifying explicitely styles for this source.

NOTE: Some old completion styles are not working fine with Helm
and are disabled by default in
`helm-blacklist-completion-styles'.  They are anyway not useful in
Helm because 'helm style supersedes these styles.

** Helm mode

`helm-mode' toggles Helm completion in native Emacs functions, so
when you turn `helm-mode' on, commands like `switch-to-buffer'
will use Helm completion instead of the usual Emacs completion
buffer.

*** What gets or does not get \"helmized\" when `helm-mode' is enabled?

Helm provides generic completion on all Emacs functions using
`completing-read', `completion-in-region' and their derivatives,
e.g. `read-file-name'.  Helm exposes a user variable to control
which function to use for a specific Emacs command:
`helm-completing-read-handlers-alist'.  If the function for a
specific command is nil, it turns off Helm completion.  See the
variable documentation for more infos.

*** Helm functions vs helmized Emacs functions

While there are Helm functions that perform the same completion
as other helmized Emacs functions, e.g. `switch-to-buffer' and
`helm-buffers-list', the native Helm functions like
`helm-buffers-list' can receive new features that allow marking
candidates, have several actions, etc.  Whereas the helmized Emacs
functions only have Helm completion, Emacs can provide no more
than one action for this function.  This is the intended behavior.

Generally you are better off using the native Helm command than
the helmized Emacs equivalent.

*** Completion behavior with Helm and completion-at-point

Helm is NOT completing dynamically.  That means that when you are
completing some text at point, completion is done against this
text and subsequent characters you add AFTER this text.  This
allows you to use matching methods provided by Helm, that is multi
matching or fuzzy matching (see [[Matching in Helm][Matching in
Helm]]).

Completion is not done dynamically (against `helm-pattern')
because backend functions (i.e. `completion-at-point-functions')
are not aware of Helm matching methods.

By behaving like this, the benefit is that you can fully use Helm
matching methods but you can't start a full completion against a
prefix different than the initial text you have at point.  Helm
warns you against this by colorizing the initial input and sends
a user-error message when trying to delete backward text beyond
this limit at first hit on DEL.  A second hit on DEL within a
short delay (1s) quits Helm and delete-backward char in
current-buffer.

** Helm help

\\[helm-documentation]: Show all Helm documentations concatenated
in one org file.

From a Helm session, just hit \\<helm-map>\\[helm-help] to have
the documentation for the current source followed by the global
Helm documentation.

While in the help buffer, most of the Emacs regular key bindings
are available; the most important ones are shown in minibuffer.
However, due to implementation restrictions, no regular Emacs
keymap is used (it runs in a loop when reading the help buffer).
Only simple bindings are available and they are defined in
`helm-help-hkmap', which is a simple alist of (key . function).
You can define or redefine bindings in help with
`helm-help-define-key' or by adding/removing entries directly in
`helm-help-hkmap'.
See `helm-help-hkmap' for restrictions on bindings and functions.

The documentation of default bindings are:

** Customize Helm

Helm provides a lot of user variables for extensive customization.
From any Helm session, type \\<helm-map>\\[helm-customize-group]
to jump to the current source `custom' group.  Helm also has a
special group for faces you can access via `M-x customize-group
RET helm-faces'.

Note: Some sources may not have their group set and default to
the `helm' group.

** Display Helm in windows and frames

You can display the Helm completion buffer in many different
window configurations, see the custom interface to discover the
different windows configurations available (See [[Customize Helm][Customize Helm]] to jump to custom interface).
When using Emacs in a graphic display (i.e. not in a terminal) you can as
well display your Helm buffers in separated frames globally for
all Helm commands or separately for specific Helm commands.
See `helm-display-function' and `helm-commands-using-frame'.
See also [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki/frame][helm wiki]] for more infos.

There is a variable to allow reusing frame instead of deleting
and creating a new one at each session, see `helm-display-buffer-reuse-frame'.
Normally you don't have to use this, it have been made to workaround
slow frame popup in Emacs-26, to workaround this slowness in Emacs-26 use instead

#+begin_src elisp 
    (when (= emacs-major-version 26)
      (setq x-wait-for-event-timeout nil))
#+end_src

WARNING:
There is a package called Posframe and also one called Helm-posframe,
you DO NOT need these packages to display helm buffers in frames.
Thus Posframe package use child frames which have no minibuffers
and are by the way not compatible with Helm.

\[1] Behavior may change depending context in some source e.g. `helm-find-files'.

\[2] Delete from point to end or all depending on the value of
`helm-delete-minibuffer-contents-from-point'.

NOTE: Any of these bindings are from `helm-map' and may be
overriten by the map specific to the current source in use (each
source can have its own keymap).

** The actions menu

You can display the action menu in the same window
as helm candidates (default) or in a side window according to
`helm-show-action-window-other-window' value.

When the action menu popup, the helm prompt is used to narrow
down this menu, no more candidates.

When `helm-allow-mouse' is non nil, you can use as well
mouse-3 (right click) in the candidate zone to select actions
with the mouse once your candidate is selected.

** Action transformers

You may be surprized to see your actions list changing depending
on the context.  This happen when a source has an action
transformer function which checks the current selected candidate
and adds specific actions for this candidate.

** Shortcuts for n-th first actions

f1-f12: Execute n-th action where n is 1 to 12.

** Shortcuts for executing the default action on the n-th candidate

Helm does not display line numbers by default, with Emacs-26+ you
can enable it permanently in all helm buffers with:

    (add-hook 'helm-after-initialize-hook 'helm-init-relative-display-line-numbers)

You can also toggle line numbers with
\\<helm-map>\\[helm-display-line-numbers-mode] in current Helm
buffer.

Of course when enabling `global-display-line-numbers-mode' Helm
buffers will have line numbers as well. \(Don't forget to
customize `display-line-numbers-type' to relative).

In Emacs versions < to 26 you will have to use
[[https://github.com/coldnew/linum-relative][linum-relative]]
package and `helm-linum-relative-mode'.

Then when line numbers are enabled with one of the methods above
the following keys are available([1]):

C-x <n>: Execute default action on the n-th candidate before
currently selected candidate.

C-c <n>: Execute default action on the n-th candidate after
current selected candidate.

\"n\" is limited to 1-9.  For larger jumps use other navigation
keys.

\[1] Note that the key bindings are always available even if line
numbers are not displayed.  They are just useless in this case.

** Mouse control in Helm

A basic support for the mouse is provided when the user sets
`helm-allow-mouse' to non-nil.

- mouse-1 selects the candidate.
- mouse-2 executes the default action on selected candidate.
- mouse-3 pops up the action menu.

Note: When mouse control is enabled in Helm, it also lets you
click around and lose the minibuffer focus: you'll have to click
on the Helm buffer or the minibuffer to retrieve control of your
Helm session.

** Marked candidates

You can mark candidates to execute an action on all of them
instead of the current selected candidate only.  (See bindings
below.) Most Helm actions operate on marked candidates unless
candidate-marking is explicitely forbidden for a specific source.

- To mark/unmark a candidate, use
\\[helm-toggle-visible-mark].  (See bindings below.) With a
numeric prefix arg mark ARG candidates forward, if ARG is
negative mark ARG candidates backward.

- To mark all visible unmarked candidates at once in current
source use \\[helm-mark-all].  With a prefix argument, mark all
candidates in all sources.

- To unmark all visible marked candidates at once use
  \\[helm-unmark-all].

- To mark/unmark all candidates at once use
\\[helm-toggle-all-marks].  With a prefix argument, mark/unmark
all candidates in all sources.

Note: When multiple candidates are selected across different
sources, only the candidates of the current source will be used
when executing most actions (as different sources can have
different actions).  Some actions support multi-source marking
however.

** Follow candidates

When `helm-follow-mode' is on (\\<helm-map>\\[helm-follow-mode]
to toggle it), moving up and down Helm session or updating the
list of candidates will automatically execute the
persistent-action as specified for the current source.

If `helm-follow-mode-persistent' is non-nil, the state of the
mode will be restored for the following Helm sessions.

If you just want to follow candidates occasionally without
enabling `helm-follow-mode', you can use
\\<helm-map>\\[helm-follow-action-forward] or
\\[helm-follow-action-backward] instead.  Conversely, when
`helm-follow-mode' is enabled, those commands go to previous/next
line without executing the persistent action.

** Special yes, no or yes for all answers

You may be prompted in the minibuffer to answer by [y,n,!,q] in
some places for confirmation.

- y  mean yes
- no mean no
- !  mean yes for all
- q  mean quit or abort current operation.

When using ! you will not be prompted for the same thing in
current operation any more, e.g. file deletion, file copy etc...

** Moving in `helm-buffer'

You can move in `helm-buffer' with the usual commands used in
Emacs: \(\\<helm-map>\\[helm-next-line],
\\<helm-map>\\[helm-previous-line], etc.  See above basic
commands.  When `helm-buffer' contains more than one source,
change source with \\<helm-map>\\[helm-next-source] and
\\[helm-previous-source].

Note: When reaching the end of a source,
\\<helm-map>\\[helm-next-line] will *not* go to the next source
when variable `helm-move-to-line-cycle-in-source' is non-nil, so
you will have to use \\<helm-map>\\[helm-next-source] and
\\[helm-previous-source].

** Resume previous session from current Helm session

You can use `C-c n' (`helm-run-cycle-resume') to cycle in
resumables sources.  `C-c n' is a special key set with
`helm-define-key-with-subkeys' which, after pressing it, allows
you to keep cycling with further `n'.

Tip: You can bound the same key in `global-map' to
     `helm-cycle-resume' with `helm-define-key-with-subkeys' to
     let you transparently cycle sessions, Helm fired up or not.
     You can also bind the cycling commands to single key
     presses (e.g., `S-<f1>') this time with a simple
     `define-key'.  (Note that `S-<f1>' is not available in
     terminals.)

Note: `helm-define-key-with-subkeys' is available only once Helm
is loaded.

You can also use
\\<helm-map>\\[helm-resume-previous-session-after-quit] to resume
the previous session, or
\\<helm-map>\\[helm-resume-list-buffers-after-quit] to have
completion on all resumable buffers.

** Global commands

*** Resume Helm session from outside Helm

\\<global-map>\\[helm-resume] revives the last Helm session.
Binding a key to this command will greatly improve Helm
interactivity, e.g. when quitting Helm accidentally.

You can call \\<global-map>\\[helm-resume] with a prefix argument
to choose \(with completion!) which session you'd like to resume.
You can also cycle in these sources with `helm-cycle-resume' (see
above).

** Debugging Helm

Helm exposes the special variable `helm-debug': setting it to
non-nil will enable Helm logging in a special outline-mode
buffer.  Helm resets the variable to nil at the end of each
session.

For convenience, \\<helm-map>\\[helm-enable-or-switch-to-debug]
allows you to turn on debugging for this session only.  To avoid
accumulating log entries while you are typing patterns, you can
use \\<helm-map>\\[helm-toggle-suspend-update] to turn off
updating.  When you are ready turn it on again to resume logging.

Once you exit your Helm session you can access the debug buffer
with `helm-debug-open-last-log'.

Note: Be aware that Helm log buffers grow really fast, so use
`helm-debug' only when needed.

** Writing your own Helm sources

Writing simple sources for your own usage is easy.  When calling
the `helm' function, the sources are added the :sources slot
which can be a symbol or a list of sources.  Sources can be built
with different EIEIO classes depending on what you want to do.  To
simplify this, several `helm-build-*' macros are provided.  Below
there are simple examples to start with.

We will not go further here, see
[[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki/Developing][Helm wiki]]
and the source code for more information and more complex
examples.

PLIST is a list like

\(:key1 val1 :key2 val2 ...)

 or

\(&optional sources input prompt resume preselect
            buffer keymap default history allow-nest).

** Keywords

Keywords supported:

- :sources
- :input
- :prompt
- :resume
- :preselect
- :buffer
- :keymap
- :default
- :history
- :allow-nest

Extra LOCAL-VARS keywords are supported, see the \"** Other
keywords\" section below.

Basic keywords are the following:

*** :sources

One of the following:

- List of sources
- Symbol whose value is a list of sources
- Alist representing a Helm source.
  - In this case the source has no name and is referenced in
    `helm-sources' as a whole alist.

*** :input

Initial input of minibuffer (temporary value of `helm-pattern')

*** :prompt

Minibuffer prompt. Default value is `helm--prompt'.

*** :resume

If t, allow resumption of the previous session of this Helm
command, skipping initialization.

If \\='noresume, this instance of `helm' cannot be resumed.

*** :preselect

Initially selected candidate (string or regexp).

*** :buffer

Buffer name for this Helm session. `helm-buffer' will take this value.

*** :keymap

\[Obsolete]

Keymap used at the start of this Helm session.

It is overridden by keymaps specified in sources, and is kept
only for backward compatibility.

Keymaps should be specified in sources using the :keymap slot
instead. See `helm-source'.

This keymap is not restored by `helm-resume'.

*** :default

Default value inserted into the minibuffer \ with
\\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element].

It can be a string or a list of strings, in this case
\\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element] cycles through
the list items, starting with the first.

If nil, `thing-at-point' is used.

If `helm-maybe-use-default-as-input' is non-nil, display is
updated using this value if this value matches, otherwise it is
ignored. If :input is specified, it takes precedence on :default.

*** :history

Minibuffer input, by default, is pushed to `minibuffer-history'.

When an argument HISTORY is provided, input is pushed to
HISTORY. HISTORY should be a valid symbol.

*** :allow-nest

Allow running this Helm command in a running Helm session.

** Other keywords

Other keywords are interpreted as local variables of this Helm
session. The `helm-' prefix can be omitted. For example,

\(helm :sources \\='helm-source-buffers-list
       :buffer \"*helm buffers*\"
       :candidate-number-limit 10)

Starts a Helm session with the variable
`helm-candidate-number-limit' set to 10.

** Backward compatibility

For backward compatibility, positional parameters are
supported:

\(helm sources input prompt resume preselect
       buffer keymap default history allow-nest)

However, the use of non-keyword args is deprecated.

\(fn &key SOURCES INPUT PROMPT RESUME PRESELECT BUFFER KEYMAP DEFAULT HISTORY ALLOW-NEST OTHER-LOCAL-VARS)"

(defun helm-candidates-in-buffer (&optional source)
  "The top level function used to store candidates with `helm-source-in-buffer'.

Candidates are stored in a buffer generated internally by
`helm-candidate-buffer' function.  Each candidate must be placed
in one line.

The buffer is created and fed in the init attribute function of
Helm.

E.g.:

     (helm-build-in-buffer-source \"test\"
       :init (lambda ()
               (helm-init-candidates-in-buffer
                   \\='global \\='(foo foa fob bar baz))))

A shortcut can be used to simplify:

     (helm-build-in-buffer-source \"test\"
       :data \\='(foo foa fob bar baz))

By default, Helm makes candidates by evaluating the candidates
function, then narrows them by `string-match' for each candidate.

But this is slow for large number of candidates.  The new way is
to store all candidates in a buffer and then narrow with
`re-search-forward'.  Search function is customizable by search
attribute.  The important point is that buffer processing is MUCH
FASTER than string list processing and is the Emacs way.

The init function writes all candidates to a newly-created
candidate buffer.  The candidates buffer is created or specified
by `helm-candidate-buffer'.  Candidates are stored in a line.

The candidates function narrows all candidates, IOW creates a
subset of candidates dynamically.

Class `helm-source-in-buffer' is implemented with three attributes:

    (candidates . helm-candidates-in-buffer)
    (volatile)
    (match identity)

The volatile attribute is needed because
`helm-candidates-in-buffer' creates candidates dynamically and
need to be called every time `helm-pattern' changes.

Because `helm-candidates-in-buffer' plays the role of `match'
attribute function, specifying `(match identity)' makes the
source slightly faster.

However if source contains `match-part' attribute, match is
computed only on part of candidate returned by the call of
function provided by this attribute.  The function should have one
arg, candidate, and return only a specific part of candidate.

To customize `helm-candidates-in-buffer' behaviour, use `search',
`get-line' and `match-part' attributes."

  "Register and return a buffer storing candidates of current source.

This is used to initialize a buffer for storing candidates for a
candidates-in-buffer source, candidates will be searched in this
buffer and displayed in `helm-buffer'.  This should be used only
in init functions, don't relay on this in other places unless you
know what you are doing.

This function is still in public API only for backward
compatibility, you should use instead
`helm-init-candidates-in-buffer' for initializing your sources.

Internally, this function is called without argument and returns
the buffer corresponding to current source i.e.
`helm--source-name' which is available in only some places.

Acceptable values of BUFFER-SPEC:

- global (a symbol)
  Create a new global candidates buffer,
  named \" *helm candidates:SOURCE*\".
  This is used by `helm-init-candidates-in-buffer' and it is
  the most common usage of BUFFER-SPEC.
  The buffer will be killed and recreated at each new
  helm-session.

- local (a symbol)
  Create a new local candidates buffer,
  named \" *helm candidates:SOURCE*HELM-CURRENT-BUFFER\".
  You may want to use this when you want to have a different
  buffer each time source is used from a different
  `helm-current-buffer'.
  The buffer is erased and refilled at each new session but not
  killed. You probably don't want to use this value for
  BUFFER-SPEC.

- nil (omit)
  Only return the candidates buffer of current source if found.

- A buffer
  Register a buffer as a candidates buffer.
  The buffer needs to exists, it is not created.
  This allow you to use the buffer as a cache, it is faster
  because the buffer is already drawn, but be careful when using
  this as you may mangle your buffer depending on what you write
  in your init(s) function, IOW don't modify the contents of the
  buffer in init(s) function but in a transformer.
  The buffer is not erased nor deleted.
  Generally it is safer to use a copy of buffer inserted
  in a global or local buffer.

If for some reasons a global buffer and a local buffer exist and
are belonging to the same source, the local buffer takes
precedence on the global one and is used instead.

When forcing update only the global and local buffers are killed
