1 Introduction
**************

Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented as
an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.  While
we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each and every
Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced Git users
to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks directly from
within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only Magit and Git
itself deserve to be called porcelains.

   Staging and otherwise applying changes is one of the most important
features in a Git porcelain and here Magit outshines anything else,
including Git itself.  Git’s own staging interface (‘git add --patch’)
is so cumbersome that many users only use it in exceptional cases.  In
Magit staging a hunk or even just part of a hunk is as trivial as
staging all changes made to a file.

   The most visible part of Magit’s interface is the status buffer,
which displays information about the current repository.  Its content is
created by running several Git commands and making their output
actionable.  Among other things, it displays information about the
current branch, lists unpulled and unpushed changes and contains
sections displaying the staged and unstaged changes.  That might sound
noisy, but, since sections are collapsible, it’s not.

   To stage or unstage a change one places the cursor on the change and
then types ‘s’ or ‘u’.  The change can be a file or a hunk, or when the
region is active (i.e., when there is a selection) several files or
hunks, or even just part of a hunk.  The change or changes that these
commands - and many others - would act on are highlighted.

   Magit also implements several other "apply variants" in addition to
staging and unstaging.  One can discard or reverse a change, or apply it
to the working tree.  Git’s own porcelain only supports this for staging
and unstaging and you would have to do something like ‘git diff ... |
??? | git apply ...’ to discard, revert, or apply a single hunk on the
command line.  In fact that’s exactly what Magit does internally (which
is what lead to the term "apply variants").

   Magit isn’t just for Git experts, but it does assume some prior
experience with Git as well as Emacs.  That being said, many users have
reported that using Magit was what finally taught them what Git is
capable of and how to use it to its fullest.  Other users wished they
had switched to Emacs sooner so that they would have gotten their hands
on Magit earlier.

   While one has to know the basic features of Emacs to be able to make
full use of Magit, acquiring just enough Emacs skills doesn’t take long
and is worth it, even for users who prefer other editors.  Vim users are
advised to give Evil (https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil), the
"Extensible VI Layer for Emacs", and Spacemacs
(https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs), an "Emacs starter-kit focused
on Evil" a try.

   Magit provides a consistent and efficient Git porcelain.  After a
short learning period, you will be able to perform most of your daily
version control tasks faster than you would on the command line.  You
will likely also start using features that seemed too daunting in the
past.

   Magit fully embraces Git.  It exposes many advanced features using a
simple but flexible interface instead of only wrapping the trivial ones
like many GUI clients do.  Of course Magit supports logging, cloning,
pushing, and other commands that usually don’t fail in spectacular ways;
but it also supports tasks that often cannot be completed in a single
step.  Magit fully supports tasks such as merging, rebasing,
cherry-picking, reverting, and blaming by not only providing a command
to initiate these tasks but also by displaying context sensitive
information along the way and providing commands that are useful for
resolving conflicts and resuming the sequence after doing so.

   Magit wraps and in many cases improves upon at least the following
Git porcelain commands: ‘add’, ‘am’, ‘bisect’, ‘blame’, ‘branch’,
‘checkout’, ‘cherry’, ‘cherry-pick’, ‘clean’, ‘clone’, ‘commit’,
‘config’, ‘describe’, ‘diff’, ‘fetch’, ‘format-patch’, ‘init’, ‘log’,
‘merge’, ‘merge-tree’, ‘mv’, ‘notes’, ‘pull’, ‘rebase’, ‘reflog’,
‘remote’, ‘request-pull’, ‘reset’, ‘revert’, ‘rm’, ‘show’, ‘stash’,
‘submodule’, ‘subtree’, ‘tag’, and ‘worktree.’ Many more Magit porcelain
commands are implemented on top of Git plumbing commands.

2 Installation
**************

Magit can be installed using Emacs’ package manager or manually from its
development repository.

* Menu:

* Installing from Melpa::
* Installing from the Git Repository::
* Post-Installation Tasks::


File: magit.info,  Node: Installing from Melpa,  Next: Installing from the Git Repository,  Up: Installation

2.1 Installing from Melpa
=========================

Magit is available from Melpa and Melpa-Stable.  If you haven’t used
Emacs’ package manager before, then it is high time you familiarize
yourself with it by reading the documentation in the Emacs manual, see
*note (emacs)Packages::.  Then add one of the archives to
‘package-archives’:

   • To use Melpa:

     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)

   • To use Melpa-Stable:

     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)

   Once you have added your preferred archive, you need to update the
local package list using:

     M-x package-refresh-contents RET

   Once you have done that, you can install Magit and its dependencies
using:

     M-x package-install RET magit RET

   Now see *note Post-Installation Tasks::.


File: magit.info,  Node: Installing from the Git Repository,  Next: Post-Installation Tasks,  Prev: Installing from Melpa,  Up: Installation

2.2 Installing from the Git Repository
======================================

Magit depends on the ‘compat’, ‘dash’, ‘transient’ and ‘with-editor’
libraries which are available from Melpa and Melpa-Stable.  Install them
using ‘M-x package-install RET <package> RET’.  Of course you may also
install them manually from their repository.

   Then clone the Magit repository:

     $ git clone https://github.com/magit/magit.git ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/magit
     $ cd ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/magit

   Then compile the libraries and generate the info manuals:

     $ make

   If you haven’t installed ‘compat’, ‘dash’, ‘transient’ and
‘with-editor’ from Melpa or at ‘/path/to/magit/../<package>’, then you
have to tell ‘make’ where to find them.  To do so create the file
‘/path/to/magit/config.mk’ with the following content before running
‘make’:

     LOAD_PATH  = -L ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/magit/lisp
     LOAD_PATH += -L ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/dash
     LOAD_PATH += -L ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/transient/lisp
     LOAD_PATH += -L ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/with-editor/lisp
     LOAD_PATH += -L ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/compat

   Finally add this to your init file:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/magit/lisp")
     (require 'magit)

     (with-eval-after-load 'info
       (info-initialize)
       (add-to-list 'Info-directory-list
                    "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/magit/Documentation/"))

   Of course if you installed the dependencies manually as well, then
you have to tell Emacs about them too, by prefixing the above with:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/dash")
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/transient/lisp")
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/with-editor")

   Note that you have to add the ‘lisp’ subdirectory to the ‘load-path’,
not the top-level of the repository, and that elements of ‘load-path’
should not end with a slash, while those of ‘Info-directory-list’
should.

   Instead of requiring the feature ‘magit’, you could load just the
autoload definitions, by loading the file ‘magit-autoloads.el’.

     (load "/path/to/magit/lisp/magit-autoloads")

   Instead of running Magit directly from the repository by adding that
to the ‘load-path’, you might want to instead install it in some other
directory using ‘sudo make install’ and setting ‘load-path’ accordingly.

   To update Magit use:

     $ git pull
     $ make

   At times it might be necessary to run ‘make clean all’ instead.

   To view all available targets use ‘make help’.

   Now see *note Post-Installation Tasks::.


File: magit.info,  Node: Post-Installation Tasks,  Prev: Installing from the Git Repository,  Up: Installation

2.3 Post-Installation Tasks
===========================

After installing Magit you should verify that you are indeed using the
Magit, Git, and Emacs releases you think you are using.  It’s best to
restart Emacs before doing so, to make sure you are not using an
outdated value for ‘load-path’.

     M-x magit-version RET

   should display something like

     Magit 2.8.0, Git 2.10.2, Emacs 25.1.1, gnu/linux

   Then you might also want to read about options that many users likely
want to customize.  See *note Essential Settings::.

   To be able to follow cross references to Git manpages found in this
manual, you might also have to manually install the ‘gitman’ info
manual, or advice ‘Info-follow-nearest-node’ to instead open the actual
manpage.  See *note How to install the gitman info manual?::.

   If you are completely new to Magit then see *note Getting Started::.

   If you run into problems, then please see the *note FAQ::.  Also see
the *note Debugging Tools::.

   And last but not least please consider making a donation, to ensure
that I can keep working on Magit.  See <https://magit.vc/donations>.
for various donation options.

3 Getting Started
*****************

This short tutorial describes the most essential features that many
Magitians use on a daily basis.  It only scratches the surface but
should be enough to get you started.

   IMPORTANT: It is safest if you clone some repository just for this
tutorial.  Alternatively you can use an existing local repository, but
if you do that, then you should commit all uncommitted changes before
proceeding.

   Type ‘C-x g’ to display information about the current Git repository
in a dedicated buffer, called the status buffer.

   Most Magit commands are commonly invoked from the status buffer.  It
can be considered the primary interface for interacting with Git using
Magit.  Many other Magit buffers may exist at a given time, but they are
often created from this buffer.

   Depending on what state your repository is in, this buffer may
contain sections titled "Staged changes", "Unstaged changes", "Unmerged
into origin/master", "Unpushed to origin/master", and many others.

   Since we are starting from a safe state, which you can easily return
to (by doing a ‘git reset --hard PRE-MAGIT-STATE’), there currently are
no staged or unstaged changes.  Edit some files and save the changes.
Then go back to the status buffer, while at the same time refreshing it,
by typing ‘C-x g’.  (When the status buffer, or any Magit buffer for
that matter, is the current buffer, then you can also use just ‘g’ to
refresh it).

   Move between sections using ‘p’ and ‘n’.  Note that the bodies of
some sections are hidden.  Type ‘TAB’ to expand or collapse the section
at point.  You can also use ‘C-tab’ to cycle the visibility of the
current section and its children.  Move to a file section inside the
section named "Unstaged changes" and type ‘s’ to stage the changes you
have made to that file.  That file now appears under "Staged changes".

   Magit can stage and unstage individual hunks, not just complete
files.  Move to the file you have just staged, expand it using ‘TAB’,
move to one of the hunks using ‘n’, and unstage just that by typing ‘u’.
Note how the staging (‘s’) and unstaging (‘u’) commands operate on the
change at point.  Many other commands behave the same way.

   You can also un-/stage just part of a hunk.  Inside the body of a
hunk section (move there using ‘C-n’), set the mark using ‘C-SPC’ and
move down until some added and/or removed lines fall inside the region
but not all of them.  Again type ‘s’ to stage.

   It is also possible to un-/stage multiple files at once.  Move to a
file section, type ‘C-SPC’, move to the next file using ‘n’, and then
‘s’ to stage both files.  Note that both the mark and point have to be
on the headings of sibling sections for this to work.  If the region
looks like it does in other buffers, then it doesn’t select Magit
sections that can be acted on as a unit.

   And then of course you want to commit your changes.  Type ‘c’.  This
shows the available commit commands and arguments in a buffer at the
bottom of the frame.  Each command and argument is prefixed with the key
that invokes/sets it.  Do not worry about this for now.  We want to
create a "normal" commit, which is done by typing ‘c’ again.

   Now two new buffers appear.  One is for writing the commit message,
the other shows a diff with the changes that you are about to commit.
Write a message and then type ‘C-c C-c’ to actually create the commit.

   You probably don’t want to push the commit you just created because
you just committed some random changes, but if that is not the case you
could push it by typing ‘P’ to show all the available push commands and
arguments and then ‘p’ to push to a branch with the same name as the
local branch onto the remote configured as the push-remote.  (If the
push-remote is not configured yet, then you would first be prompted for
the remote to push to.)

   So far we have mentioned the commit and push menu commands.  These
are probably among the menus you will be using the most, but many others
exist.  To show a menu that lists all other menus (as well as the
various apply commands and some other essential commands), type ‘h’.
Try a few.  (Such menus are also called "transient prefix commands" or
just "transients".)

   The key bindings in that menu correspond to the bindings in Magit
buffers, including but not limited to the status buffer.  So you could
type ‘h d’ to bring up the diff menu, but once you remember that "d"
stands for "diff", you would usually do so by just typing ‘d’.

   This "prefix of prefixes" is useful even once you have memorized all
the bindings, as it can provide easy access to Magit commands from
non-Magit buffers.  So, by default, it is globally bound to ‘C-x M-g’.

   A similar menu featuring (for the most part) commands that act on
just the file being visited in the current buffer, is globally bound to
‘C-c M-g’.  That binding can also be used in buffers, which do not visit
a file, but then only a subset of the commands is available.

   The global key bindings mentioned in the previous two paragraphs are
quite inconvenient.  We recommend using ‘C-c g’ and ‘C-c f’ instead, but
cannot use those key sequences by default because they are strickly
reserved for bindings added by the user.  See *note Global Bindings::,
if you want to explicitly opt-in to the recommended key bindings.

   Magit also provides context menus and other mouse commands, see *note
Mouse Support::.

   It is not necessary that you do so now, but if you stick with Magit,
then it is highly recommended that you read the next section too.

4.1 Modes and Buffers
=====================

Magit provides several major-modes.  For each of these modes there
usually exists only one buffer per repository.  Separate modes and thus
buffers exist for commits, diffs, logs, and some other things.

   Besides these special purpose buffers, there also exists an overview
buffer, called the *status buffer*.  It’s usually from this buffer that
the user invokes Git commands, or creates or visits other buffers.

   In this manual we often speak about "Magit buffers".  By that we mean
buffers whose major-modes derive from ‘magit-mode’.

‘M-x magit-toggle-buffer-lock’
     This command locks the current buffer to its value or if the buffer
     is already locked, then it unlocks it.

     Locking a buffer to its value prevents it from being reused to
     display another value.  The name of a locked buffer contains its
     value, which allows telling it apart from other locked buffers and
     the unlocked buffer.

     Not all Magit buffers can be locked to their values; for example,
     it wouldn’t make sense to lock a status buffer.

     There can only be a single unlocked buffer using a certain
     major-mode per repository.  So when a buffer is being unlocked and
     another unlocked buffer already exists for that mode and
     repository, then the former buffer is instead deleted and the
     latter is displayed in its place.

File: magit.info,  Node: Switching Buffers,  Next: Naming Buffers,  Up: Modes and Buffers

4.1.1 Switching Buffers
-----------------------

 -- Function: magit-display-buffer buffer &optional display-function
     This function is a wrapper around ‘display-buffer’ and is used to
     display any Magit buffer.  It displays BUFFER in some window and,
     unlike ‘display-buffer’, also selects that window, provided
     ‘magit-display-buffer-noselect’ is ‘nil’.  It also runs the hooks
     mentioned below.

     If optional DISPLAY-FUNCTION is non-nil, then that is used to
     display the buffer.  Usually that is ‘nil’ and the function
     specified by ‘magit-display-buffer-function’ is used.

 -- Variable: magit-display-buffer-noselect
     When this is non-nil, then ‘magit-display-buffer’ only displays the
     buffer but forgoes also selecting the window.  This variable should
     not be set globally, it is only intended to be let-bound, by code
     that automatically updates "the other window".  This is used for
     example when the revision buffer is updated when you move inside
     the log buffer.

 -- User Option: magit-display-buffer-function
     The function specified here is called by ‘magit-display-buffer’
     with one argument, a buffer, to actually display that buffer.  This
     function should call ‘display-buffer’ with that buffer as first and
     a list of display actions as second argument.

     Magit provides several functions, listed below, that are suitable
     values for this option.  If you want to use different rules, then a
     good way of doing that is to start with a copy of one of these
     functions and then adjust it to your needs.

     Instead of using a wrapper around ‘display-buffer’, that function
     itself can be used here, in which case the display actions have to
     be specified by adding them to ‘display-buffer-alist’ instead.

     To learn about display actions, see *note (elisp)Choosing Window::.

 -- Function: magit-display-buffer-traditional buffer
     This function is the current default value of the option
     ‘magit-display-buffer-function’.  Before that option and this
     function were added, the behavior was hard-coded in many places all
     over the code base but now all the rules are contained in this one
     function (except for the "noselect" special case mentioned above).

 -- Function: magit-display-buffer-same-window-except-diff-v1
     This function displays most buffers in the currently selected
     window.  If a buffer’s mode derives from ‘magit-diff-mode’ or
     ‘magit-process-mode’, it is displayed in another window.

 -- Function: magit-display-buffer-fullframe-status-v1
     This function fills the entire frame when displaying a status
     buffer.  Otherwise, it behaves like
     ‘magit-display-buffer-traditional’.

 -- Function: magit-display-buffer-fullframe-status-topleft-v1
     This function fills the entire frame when displaying a status
     buffer.  It behaves like ‘magit-display-buffer-fullframe-status-v1’
     except that it displays buffers that derive from ‘magit-diff-mode’
     or ‘magit-process-mode’ to the top or left of the current buffer
     rather than to the bottom or right.  As a result, Magit buffers
     tend to pop up on the same side as they would if
     ‘magit-display-buffer-traditional’ were in use.

 -- Function: magit-display-buffer-fullcolumn-most-v1
     This function displays most buffers so that they fill the entire
     height of the frame.  However, the buffer is displayed in another
     window if (1) the buffer’s mode derives from ‘magit-process-mode’,
     or (2) the buffer’s mode derives from ‘magit-diff-mode’, provided
     that the mode of the current buffer derives from ‘magit-log-mode’
     or ‘magit-cherry-mode’.

 -- User Option: magit-pre-display-buffer-hook
     This hook is run by ‘magit-display-buffer’ before displaying the
     buffer.

 -- Function: magit-save-window-configuration
     This function saves the current window configuration.  Later when
     the buffer is buried, it may be restored by
     ‘magit-restore-window-configuration’.

 -- User Option: magit-post-display-buffer-hook
     This hook is run by ‘magit-display-buffer’ after displaying the
     buffer.

 -- Function: magit-maybe-set-dedicated
     This function remembers if a new window had to be created to
     display the buffer, or whether an existing window was reused.  This
     information is later used by ‘magit-mode-quit-window’, to determine
     whether the window should be deleted when its last Magit buffer is
     buried.

4.1.2 Naming Buffers
--------------------

 -- User Option: magit-generate-buffer-name-function
     The function used to generate the names of Magit buffers.

     Such a function should take the options
     ‘magit-uniquify-buffer-names’ as well as ‘magit-buffer-name-format’
     into account.  If it doesn’t, then should be clearly stated in the
     doc-string.  And if it supports %-sequences beyond those mentioned
     in the doc-string of the option ‘magit-buffer-name-format’, then
     its own doc-string should describe the additions.

 -- Function: magit-generate-buffer-name-default-function mode
     This function returns a buffer name suitable for a buffer whose
     major-mode is MODE and which shows information about the repository
     in which ‘default-directory’ is located.

     This function uses ‘magit-buffer-name-format’ and supporting all of
     the %-sequences mentioned the documentation of that option.  It
     also respects the option ‘magit-uniquify-buffer-names’.

 -- User Option: magit-buffer-name-format
     The format string used to name Magit buffers.

     At least the following %-sequences are supported:

        • ‘%m’

          The name of the major-mode, but with the ‘-mode’ suffix
          removed.

        • ‘%M’

          Like ‘%m’ but abbreviate ‘magit-status-mode’ as ‘magit’.

        • ‘%v’

          The value the buffer is locked to, in parentheses, or an empty
          string if the buffer is not locked to a value.

        • ‘%V’

          Like ‘%v’, but the string is prefixed with a space, unless it
          is an empty string.

        • ‘%t’

          The top-level directory of the working tree of the repository,
          or if ‘magit-uniquify-buffer-names’ is non-nil an abbreviation
          of that.

        • ‘%x’

          If ‘magit-uniquify-buffer-names’ is nil "*", otherwise the
          empty string.  Due to limitations of the ‘uniquify’ package,
          buffer names must end with the path.

     The value should always contain ‘%m’ or ‘%M’, ‘%v’ or ‘%V’, and
     ‘%t’.  If ‘magit-uniquify-buffer-names’ is non-nil, then the value
     must end with ‘%t’ or ‘%t%x’.  See issue #2841.

 -- User Option: magit-uniquify-buffer-names
     This option controls whether the names of Magit buffers are
     uniquified.  If the names are not being uniquified, then they
     contain the full path of the top-level of the working tree of the
     corresponding repository.  If they are being uniquified, then they
     end with the basename of the top-level, or if that would conflict
     with the name used for other buffers, then the names of all these
     buffers are adjusted until they no longer conflict.

     This is done using the ‘uniquify’ package; customize its options to
     control how buffer names are uniquified.

4.1.3 Quitting Windows
----------------------

‘q’ (‘magit-mode-bury-buffer’)
     This command buries or kills the current Magit buffer.  The
     function specified by option ‘magit-bury-buffer-function’ is used
     to bury the buffer when called without a prefix argument or to kill
     it when called with a single prefix argument.

     When called with two or more prefix arguments then it always kills
     all Magit buffers, associated with the current project, including
     the current buffer.

 -- User Option: magit-bury-buffer-function
     The function used to actually bury or kill the current buffer.

     ‘magit-mode-bury-buffer’ calls this function with one argument.  If
     the argument is non-nil, then the function has to kill the current
     buffer.  Otherwise it has to bury it alive.  The default value
     currently is ‘magit-mode-quit-window’.

 -- Function: magit-restore-window-configuration kill-buffer
     Bury or kill the current buffer using ‘quit-window’, which is
     called with KILL-BUFFER as first and the selected window as second
     argument.

     Then restore the window configuration that existed right before the
     current buffer was displayed in the selected frame.  Unfortunately
     that also means that point gets adjusted in all the buffers, which
     are being displayed in the selected frame.

 -- Function: magit-mode-quit-window kill-buffer
     Bury or kill the current buffer using ‘quit-window’, which is
     called with KILL-BUFFER as first and the selected window as second
     argument.

     Then, if the window was originally created to display a Magit
     buffer and the buried buffer was the last remaining Magit buffer
     that was ever displayed in the window, then that is deleted.

4.1.4 Automatic Refreshing of Magit Buffers
-------------------------------------------

After running a command which may change the state of the current
repository, the current Magit buffer and the corresponding status buffer
are refreshed.  The status buffer can be automatically refreshed
whenever a buffer is saved to a file inside the respective repository by
adding a hook, like so:

     (with-eval-after-load 'magit-mode
       (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'magit-after-save-refresh-status t))

   Automatically refreshing Magit buffers ensures that the displayed
information is up-to-date most of the time but can lead to a noticeable
delay in big repositories.  Other Magit buffers are not refreshed to
keep the delay to a minimum and also because doing so can sometimes be
undesirable.

   Buffers can also be refreshed explicitly, which is useful in buffers
that weren’t current during the last refresh and after changes were made
to the repository outside of Magit.

‘g’ (‘magit-refresh’)
     This command refreshes the current buffer if its major mode derives
     from ‘magit-mode’ as well as the corresponding status buffer.

     If the option ‘magit-revert-buffers’ calls for it, then it also
     reverts all unmodified buffers that visit files being tracked in
     the current repository.

‘G’ (‘magit-refresh-all’)
     This command refreshes all Magit buffers belonging to the current
     repository and also reverts all unmodified buffers that visit files
     being tracked in the current repository.

     The file-visiting buffers are always reverted, even if
     ‘magit-revert-buffers’ is nil.

 -- User Option: magit-refresh-buffer-hook
     This hook is run in each Magit buffer that was refreshed during the
     current refresh - normally the current buffer and the status
     buffer.

 -- User Option: magit-refresh-status-buffer
     When this option is non-nil, then the status buffer is
     automatically refreshed after running git for side-effects, in
     addition to the current Magit buffer, which is always refreshed
     automatically.

     Only set this to nil after exhausting all other options to improve
     performance.

 -- Function: magit-after-save-refresh-status
     This function is intended to be added to ‘after-save-hook’.  After
     doing that the corresponding status buffer is refreshed whenever a
     buffer is saved to a file inside a repository.

     Note that refreshing a Magit buffer is done by re-creating its
     contents from scratch, which can be slow in large repositories.  If
     you are not satisfied with Magit’s performance, then you should
     obviously not add this function to that hook.

4.1.5 Automatic Saving of File-Visiting Buffers
-----------------------------------------------

File-visiting buffers are by default saved at certain points in time.
This doesn’t guarantee that Magit buffers are always up-to-date, but,
provided one only edits files by editing them in Emacs and uses only
Magit to interact with Git, one can be fairly confident.  When in doubt
or after outside changes, type ‘g’ (‘magit-refresh’) to save and refresh
explicitly.

 -- User Option: magit-save-repository-buffers
     This option controls whether file-visiting buffers are saved before
     certain events.

     If this is non-nil then all modified file-visiting buffers
     belonging to the current repository may be saved before running
     commands, before creating new Magit buffers, and before explicitly
     refreshing such buffers.  If this is ‘dontask’ then this is done
     without user intervention.  If it is ‘t’ then the user has to
     confirm each save.

4.1.6 Automatic Reverting of File-Visiting Buffers
--------------------------------------------------

By default Magit automatically reverts buffers that are visiting files
that are being tracked in a Git repository, after they have changed on
disk.  When using Magit one often changes files on disk by running Git,
i.e., "outside Emacs", making this a rather important feature.

   For example, if you discard a change in the status buffer, then that
is done by running ‘git apply --reverse ...’, and Emacs considers the
file to have "changed on disk".  If Magit did not automatically revert
the buffer, then you would have to type ‘M-x revert-buffer RET RET’ in
the visiting buffer before you could continue making changes.

 -- User Option: magit-auto-revert-mode
     When this mode is enabled, then buffers that visit tracked files
     are automatically reverted after the visited files change on disk.

 -- User Option: global-auto-revert-mode
     When this mode is enabled, then any file-visiting buffer is
     automatically reverted after the visited file changes on disk.

     If you like buffers that visit tracked files to be automatically
     reverted, then you might also like any buffer to be reverted, not
     just those visiting tracked files.  If that is the case, then
     enable this mode _instead of_ ‘magit-auto-revert-mode’.

 -- User Option: magit-auto-revert-immediately
     This option controls whether Magit reverts buffers immediately.

     If this is non-nil and either ‘global-auto-revert-mode’ or
     ‘magit-auto-revert-mode’ is enabled, then Magit immediately reverts
     buffers by explicitly calling ‘auto-revert-buffers’ after running
     Git for side-effects.

     If ‘auto-revert-use-notify’ is non-nil (and file notifications are
     actually supported), then ‘magit-auto-revert-immediately’ does not
     have to be non-nil, because the reverts happen immediately anyway.

     If ‘magit-auto-revert-immediately’ and ‘auto-revert-use-notify’ are
     both ‘nil’, then reverts happen after ‘auto-revert-interval’
     seconds of user inactivity.  That is not desirable.

 -- User Option: auto-revert-use-notify
     This option controls whether file notification functions should be
     used.  Note that this variable unfortunately defaults to ‘t’ even
     on systems on which file notifications cannot be used.

 -- User Option: magit-auto-revert-tracked-only
     This option controls whether ‘magit-auto-revert-mode’ only reverts
     tracked files or all files that are located inside Git
     repositories, including untracked files and files located inside
     Git’s control directory.

 -- User Option: auto-revert-mode
     The global mode ‘magit-auto-revert-mode’ works by turning on this
     local mode in the appropriate buffers (but
     ‘global-auto-revert-mode’ is implemented differently).  You can
     also turn it on or off manually, which might be necessary if Magit
     does not notice that a previously untracked file now is being
     tracked or vice-versa.

 -- User Option: auto-revert-stop-on-user-input
     This option controls whether the arrival of user input suspends the
     automatic reverts for ‘auto-revert-interval’ seconds.

 -- User Option: auto-revert-interval
     This option controls how many seconds Emacs waits for before
     resuming suspended reverts.

 -- User Option: auto-revert-buffer-list-filter
     This option specifies an additional filter used by
     ‘auto-revert-buffers’ to determine whether a buffer should be
     reverted or not.

     This option is provided by Magit, which also advises
     ‘auto-revert-buffers’ to respect it.  Magit users who do not turn
     on the local mode ‘auto-revert-mode’ themselves, are best served by
     setting the value to ‘magit-auto-revert-repository-buffer-p’.

     However the default is nil, so as not to disturb users who do use
     the local mode directly.  If you experience delays when running
     Magit commands, then you should consider using one of the
     predicates provided by Magit - especially if you also use Tramp.

     Users who do turn on ‘auto-revert-mode’ in buffers in which Magit
     doesn’t do that for them, should likely not use any filter.  Users
     who turn on ‘global-auto-revert-mode’, do not have to worry about
     this option, because it is disregarded if the global mode is
     enabled.

 -- User Option: auto-revert-verbose
     This option controls whether Emacs reports when a buffer has been
     reverted.

   The options with the ‘auto-revert-’ prefix are located in the Custom
group named ‘auto-revert’.  The other, Magit-specific, options are
located in the ‘magit’ group.

Risk of Reverting Automatically
...............................

For the vast majority of users, automatically reverting file-visiting
buffers after they have changed on disk is harmless.

   If a buffer is modified (i.e., it contains changes that haven’t been
saved yet), then Emacs will refuse to automatically revert it.  If you
save a previously modified buffer, then that results in what is seen by
Git as an uncommitted change.  Git will then refuse to carry out any
commands that would cause these changes to be lost.  In other words, if
there is anything that could be lost, then either Git or Emacs will
refuse to discard the changes.

   However, if you use file-visiting buffers as a sort of ad hoc
"staging area", then the automatic reverts could potentially cause data
loss.  So far I have heard from only one user who uses such a workflow.

   An example: You visit some file in a buffer, edit it, and save the
changes.  Then, outside of Emacs (or at least not using Magit or by
saving the buffer) you change the file on disk again.  At this point the
buffer is the only place where the intermediate version still exists.
You have saved the changes to disk, but that has since been overwritten.
Meanwhile Emacs considers the buffer to be unmodified (because you have
not made any changes to it since you last saved it to the visited file)
and therefore would not object to it being automatically reverted.  At
this point an Auto-Revert mode would kick in.  It would check whether
the buffer is modified and since that is not the case it would revert
it.  The intermediate version would be lost.  (Actually you could still
get it back using the ‘undo’ command.)

   If your workflow depends on Emacs preserving the intermediate version
in the buffer, then you have to disable all Auto-Revert modes.  But
please consider that such a workflow would be dangerous even without
using an Auto-Revert mode, and should therefore be avoided.  If Emacs
crashes or if you quit Emacs by mistake, then you would also lose the
buffer content.  There would be no autosave file still containing the
intermediate version (because that was deleted when you saved the
buffer) and you would not be asked whether you want to save the buffer
(because it isn’t modified).

4.2 Sections
============

Magit buffers are organized into nested sections, which can be collapsed
and expanded, similar to how sections are handled in Org mode.  Each
section also has a type, and some sections also have a value.  For each
section type there can also be a local keymap, shared by all sections of
that type.

   Taking advantage of the section value and type, many commands operate
on the current section, or when the region is active and selects
sections of the same type, all of the selected sections.  Commands that
only make sense for a particular section type (as opposed to just
behaving differently depending on the type) are usually bound in section
type keymaps.

File: magit.info,  Node: Section Movement,  Next: Section Visibility,  Up: Sections

4.2.1 Section Movement
----------------------

To move within a section use the usual keys (‘C-p’, ‘C-n’, ‘C-b’, ‘C-f’
etc), whose global bindings are not shadowed.  To move to another
section use the following commands.

‘p’ (‘magit-section-backward’)
     When not at the beginning of a section, then move to the beginning
     of the current section.  At the beginning of a section, instead
     move to the beginning of the previous visible section.

‘n’ (‘magit-section-forward’)
     Move to the beginning of the next visible section.

‘M-p’ (‘magit-section-backward-siblings’)
     Move to the beginning of the previous sibling section.  If there is
     no previous sibling section, then move to the parent section
     instead.

‘M-n’ (‘magit-section-forward-siblings’)
     Move to the beginning of the next sibling section.  If there is no
     next sibling section, then move to the parent section instead.

‘^’ (‘magit-section-up’)
     Move to the beginning of the parent of the current section.

   The above commands all call the hook ‘magit-section-movement-hook’.
Any of the functions listed below can be used as members of this hook.

   You might want to remove some of the functions that Magit adds using
‘add-hook’.  In doing so you have to make sure you do not attempt to
remove function that haven’t even been added yet, for example:

     (with-eval-after-load 'magit-diff
       (remove-hook 'magit-section-movement-hook
                    'magit-hunk-set-window-start))

 -- Variable: magit-section-movement-hook
     This hook is run by all of the above movement commands, after
     arriving at the destination.

 -- Function: magit-hunk-set-window-start
     This hook function ensures that the beginning of the current
     section is visible, provided it is a ‘hunk’ section.  Otherwise, it
     does nothing.

     Loading ‘magit-diff’ adds this function to the hook.

 -- Function: magit-section-set-window-start
     This hook function ensures that the beginning of the current
     section is visible, regardless of the section’s type.  If you add
     this to ‘magit-section-movement-hook’, then you must remove the
     hunk-only variant in turn.

 -- Function: magit-log-maybe-show-more-commits
     This hook function only has an effect in log buffers, and ‘point’
     is on the "show more" section.  If that is the case, then it
     doubles the number of commits that are being shown.

     Loading ‘magit-log’ adds this function to the hook.

 -- Function: magit-log-maybe-update-revision-buffer
     When moving inside a log buffer, then this function updates the
     revision buffer, provided it is already being displayed in another
     window of the same frame.

     Loading ‘magit-log’ adds this function to the hook.

 -- Function: magit-log-maybe-update-blob-buffer
     When moving inside a log buffer and another window of the same
     frame displays a blob buffer, then this function instead displays
     the blob buffer for the commit at point in that window.

 -- Function: magit-status-maybe-update-revision-buffer
     When moving inside a status buffer, then this function updates the
     revision buffer, provided it is already being displayed in another
     window of the same frame.

 -- Function: magit-status-maybe-update-stash-buffer
     When moving inside a status buffer, then this function updates the
     stash buffer, provided it is already being displayed in another
     window of the same frame.

 -- Function: magit-status-maybe-update-blob-buffer
     When moving inside a status buffer and another window of the same
     frame displays a blob buffer, then this function instead displays
     the blob buffer for the commit at point in that window.

 -- Function: magit-stashes-maybe-update-stash-buffer
     When moving inside a buffer listing stashes, then this function
     updates the stash buffer, provided it is already being displayed in
     another window of the same frame.

 -- User Option: magit-update-other-window-delay
     Delay before automatically updating the other window.

     When moving around in certain buffers, then certain other buffers,
     which are being displayed in another window, may optionally be
     updated to display information about the section at point.

     When holding down a key to move by more than just one section, then
     that would update that buffer for each section on the way.  To
     prevent that, updating the revision buffer is delayed, and this
     option controls for how long.  For optimal experience you might
     have to adjust this delay and/or the keyboard repeat rate and delay
     of your graphical environment or operating system.


File: magit.info,  Node: Section Visibility,  Next: Section Hooks,  Prev: Section Movement,  Up: Sections

4.2.2 Section Visibility
------------------------

Magit provides many commands for changing the visibility of sections,
but all you need to get started are the next two.

‘<TAB>’ (‘magit-section-toggle’)
     Toggle the visibility of the body of the current section.

‘C-<tab>’ (‘magit-section-cycle’)
     Cycle the visibility of current section and its children.

‘M-<tab>’ (‘magit-section-cycle-diffs’)
     Cycle the visibility of diff-related sections in the current
     buffer.

‘S-<tab>’ (‘magit-section-cycle-global’)
     Cycle the visibility of all sections in the current buffer.

‘1’ (‘magit-section-show-level-1’)
‘2’ (‘magit-section-show-level-2’)
‘3’ (‘magit-section-show-level-3’)
‘4’ (‘magit-section-show-level-4’)
     Show sections surrounding the current section up to level N.

‘M-1’ (‘magit-section-show-level-1-all’)
‘M-2’ (‘magit-section-show-level-2-all’)
‘M-3’ (‘magit-section-show-level-3-all’)
‘M-4’ (‘magit-section-show-level-4-all’)
     Show all sections up to level N.

   Some functions, which are used to implement the above commands, are
also exposed as commands themselves.  By default no keys are bound to
these commands, as they are generally perceived to be much less useful.
But your mileage may vary.

 -- Command: magit-section-show
     Show the body of the current section.

 -- Command: magit-section-hide
     Hide the body of the current section.

 -- Command: magit-section-show-headings
     Recursively show headings of children of the current section.  Only
     show the headings.  Previously shown text-only bodies are hidden.

 -- Command: magit-section-show-children
     Recursively show the bodies of children of the current section.
     With a prefix argument show children down to the level of the
     current section, and hide deeper children.

 -- Command: magit-section-hide-children
     Recursively hide the bodies of children of the current section.

 -- Command: magit-section-toggle-children
     Toggle visibility of bodies of children of the current section.

   When a buffer is first created then some sections are shown expanded
while others are not.  This is hard coded.  When a buffer is refreshed
then the previous visibility is preserved.  The initial visibility of
certain sections can also be overwritten using the hook
‘magit-section-set-visibility-hook’.

 -- User Option: magit-section-initial-visibility-alist
     This options can be used to override the initial visibility of
     sections.  In the future it will also be used to define the
     defaults, but currently a section’s default is still hardcoded.

     The value is an alist.  Each element maps a section type or lineage
     to the initial visibility state for such sections.  The state has
     to be one of ‘show’ or ‘hide’, or a function that returns one of
     these symbols.  A function is called with the section as the only
     argument.

     Use the command ‘magit-describe-section-briefly’ to determine a
     section’s lineage or type.  The vector in the output is the section
     lineage and the type is the first element of that vector.
     Wildcards can be used, see ‘magit-section-match’.

 -- User Option: magit-section-cache-visibility
     This option controls for which sections the previous visibility
     state should be restored if a section disappears and later appears
     again.  The value is a boolean or a list of section types.  If t,
     then the visibility of all sections is cached.  Otherwise this is
     only done for sections whose type matches one of the listed types.

     This requires that the function ‘magit-section-cached-visibility’
     is a member of ‘magit-section-set-visibility-hook’.

 -- Variable: magit-section-set-visibility-hook
     This hook is run when first creating a buffer and also when
     refreshing an existing buffer, and is used to determine the
     visibility of the section currently being inserted.

     Each function is called with one argument, the section being
     inserted.  It should return ‘hide’ or ‘show’, or to leave the
     visibility undefined ‘nil’.  If no function decides on the
     visibility and the buffer is being refreshed, then the visibility
     is preserved; or if the buffer is being created, then the hard
     coded default is used.

     Usually this should only be used to set the initial visibility but
     not during refreshes.  If ‘magit-insert-section--oldroot’ is
     non-nil, then the buffer is being refreshed and these functions
     should immediately return ‘nil’.

 -- User Option: magit-section-visibility-indicator
     This option controls whether and how to indicate that a section can
     be expanded/collapsed.

     If nil, then no visibility indicators are shown.  Otherwise the
     value has to have one of these two forms:

        • ‘(EXPANDABLE-BITMAP . COLLAPSIBLE-BITMAP)’

          Both values have to be variables whose values are fringe
          bitmaps.  In this case every section that can be expanded or
          collapsed gets an indicator in the left fringe.

          To provide extra padding around the indicator, set
          ‘left-fringe-width’ in ‘magit-mode-hook’, e.g.:

               (add-hook 'magit-mode-hook (lambda ()
                                            (setq left-fringe-width 20)))

        • ‘(STRING . BOOLEAN)’

          In this case STRING (usually an ellipsis) is shown at the end
          of the heading of every collapsed section.  Expanded sections
          get no indicator.  The cdr controls whether the appearance of
          these ellipsis take section highlighting into account.  Doing
          so might potentially have an impact on performance, while not
          doing so is kinda ugly.

4.2.3 Section Hooks
-------------------

Which sections are inserted into certain buffers is controlled with
hooks.  This includes the status and the refs buffers.  For other
buffers, e.g., log and diff buffers, this is not possible.  The command
‘magit-describe-section’ can be used to see which hook (if any) was
responsible for inserting the section at point.

   For buffers whose sections can be customized by the user, a hook
variable called ‘magit-TYPE-sections-hook’ exists.  This hook should be
changed using ‘magit-add-section-hook’.  Avoid using ‘add-hooks’ or the
Custom interface.

   The various available section hook variables are described later in
this manual along with the appropriate "section inserter functions".

 -- Function: magit-add-section-hook hook function &optional at append
          local
     Add the function FUNCTION to the value of section hook HOOK.

     Add FUNCTION at the beginning of the hook list unless optional
     APPEND is non-nil, in which case FUNCTION is added at the end.  If
     FUNCTION already is a member then move it to the new location.

     If optional AT is non-nil and a member of the hook list, then add
     FUNCTION next to that instead.  Add before or after AT, or replace
     AT with FUNCTION depending on APPEND.  If APPEND is the symbol
     ‘replace’, then replace AT with FUNCTION.  For any other non-nil
     value place FUNCTION right after AT.  If nil, then place FUNCTION
     right before AT.  If FUNCTION already is a member of the list but
     AT is not, then leave FUNCTION where ever it already is.

     If optional LOCAL is non-nil, then modify the hook’s buffer-local
     value rather than its global value.  This makes the hook local by
     copying the default value.  That copy is then modified.

     HOOK should be a symbol.  If HOOK is void, it is first set to nil.
     HOOK’s value must not be a single hook function.  FUNCTION should
     be a function that takes no arguments and inserts one or multiple
     sections at point, moving point forward.  FUNCTION may choose not
     to insert its section(s), when doing so would not make sense.  It
     should not be abused for other side-effects.

   To remove a function from a section hook, use ‘remove-hook’.

4.2.4 Section Types and Values
------------------------------

Each section has a type, for example ‘hunk’, ‘file’, and ‘commit’.
Instances of certain section types also have a value.  The value of a
section of type ‘file’, for example, is a file name.

   Users usually do not have to worry about a section’s type and value,
but knowing them can be handy at times.

‘H’ (‘magit-describe-section’)
     This command shows information about the section at point in a
     separate buffer.

 -- Command: magit-describe-section-briefly
     This command shows information about the section at point in the
     echo area, as ‘#<magit-section VALUE [TYPE PARENT-TYPE...]
     BEGINNING-END>’.

   Many commands behave differently depending on the type of the section
at point and/or somehow consume the value of that section.  But that is
only one of the reasons why the same key may do something different,
depending on what section is current.

   Additionally for each section type a keymap *might* be defined, named
‘magit-TYPE-section-map’.  That keymap is used as text property keymap
of all text belonging to any section of the respective type.  If such a
map does not exist for a certain type, then you can define it yourself,
and it will automatically be used.

4.2.5 Section Options
---------------------

This section describes options that have an effect on more than just a
certain type of sections.  As you can see there are not many of those.

 -- User Option: magit-section-show-child-count
     Whether to append the number of children to section headings.  This
     only affects sections that could benefit from this information.


File: magit.info,  Node: Transient Commands,  Next: Transient Arguments and Buffer Variables,  Prev: Sections,  Up: Interface Concepts

4.3 Transient Commands
======================

Many Magit commands are implemented as *transient* commands.  First the
user invokes a *prefix* command, which causes its *infix* arguments and
*suffix* commands to be displayed in the echo area.  The user then
optionally sets some infix arguments and finally invokes one of the
suffix commands.

   This is implemented in the library ‘transient’.  Earlier Magit
releases used the package ‘magit-popup’ and even earlier versions
library ‘magit-key-mode’.

   Transient is documented in *note (transient)Top::.

‘C-x M-g’ (‘magit-dispatch’)
‘C-c g’ (‘magit-dispatch’)
     This transient prefix command binds most of Magit’s other prefix
     commands as suffix commands and displays them in a temporary buffer
     until one of them is invoked.  Invoking such a sub-prefix causes
     the suffixes of that command to be bound and displayed instead of
     those of ‘magit-dispatch’.

     This command is also, or especially, useful outside Magit buffers,
     so Magit by default binds it to ‘C-c M-g’ in the global keymap.
     ‘C-c g’ would be a better binding, but we cannot use that by
     default, because that key sequence is reserved for the user.  See
     *note Global Bindings:: to learn more default and recommended key
     bindings.


File: magit.info,  Node: Transient Arguments and Buffer Variables,  Next: Completion Confirmation and the Selection,  Prev: Transient Commands,  Up: Interface Concepts

4.4 Transient Arguments and Buffer Variables
============================================

The infix arguments of many of Magit’s transient prefix commands cease
to have an effect once the ‘git’ command that is called with those
arguments has returned.  Commands that create a commit are a good
example for this.  If the user changes the arguments, then that only
affects the next invocation of a suffix command.  If the same transient
prefix command is later invoked again, then the arguments are initially
reset to the default value.  This default value can be set for the
current Emacs session or saved permanently, see *note (transient)Saving
Values::.  It is also possible to cycle through previously used sets of
arguments using ‘C-M-p’ and ‘C-M-n’, see *note (transient)Using
History::.

   However the infix arguments of many other transient commands continue
to have an effect even after the ‘git’ command that was called with
those arguments has returned.  The most important commands like this are
those that display a diff or log in a dedicated buffer.  Their arguments
obviously continue to have an effect for as long as the respective diff
or log is being displayed.  Furthermore the used arguments are stored in
buffer-local variables for future reference.

   For commands in the second group it isn’t always desirable to reset
their arguments to the global value when the transient prefix command is
invoked again.

   As mentioned above, it is possible to cycle through previously used
sets of arguments while a transient popup is visible.  That means that
we could always reset the infix arguments to the default because the set
of arguments that is active in the existing buffer is only a few ‘C-M-p’
away.  Magit can be configured to behave like that, but because I expect
that most users would not find that very convenient, it is not the
default.

   Also note that it is possible to change the diff and log arguments
used in the current buffer (including the status buffer, which contains
both diff and log sections) using the respective "refresh" transient
prefix commands on ‘D’ and ‘L’.  (‘d’ and ‘l’ on the other hand are
intended to change *what* diff or log is being displayed.  It is
possible to also change *how* the diff or log is being displayed at the
same time, but if you only want to do the latter, then you should use
the refresh variants.)  Because these secondary diff and log transient
prefixes are about *changing* the arguments used in the current buffer,
they *always* start out with the set of arguments that are currently in
effect in that buffer.

   Some commands are usually invoked directly even though they can also
be invoked as the suffix of a transient prefix command.  Most
prominently ‘magit-show-commit’ is usually invoked by typing ‘RET’ while
point is on a commit in a log, but it can also be invoked from the
‘magit-diff’ transient prefix.

   When such a command is invoked directly, then it is important to
reuse the arguments as specified by the respective buffer-local values,
instead of using the default arguments.  Imagine you press ‘RET’ in a
log to display the commit at point in a different buffer and then use
‘D’ to change how the diff is displayed in that buffer.  And then you
press ‘RET’ on another commit to show that instead and the diff
arguments are reset to the default.  Not cool; so Magit does not do that
by default.

 -- User Option: magit-prefix-use-buffer-arguments
     This option controls whether the infix arguments initially shown in
     certain transient prefix commands are based on the arguments that
     are currently in effect in the buffer that their suffixes update.

     The ‘magit-diff’ and ‘magit-log’ transient prefix commands are
     affected by this option.

 -- User Option: magit-direct-use-buffer-arguments
     This option controls whether certain commands, when invoked
     directly (i.e., not as the suffix of a transient prefix command),
     use the arguments that are currently active in the buffer that they
     are about to update.  The alternative is to use the default value
     for these arguments, which might change the arguments that are used
     in the buffer.

Valid values for both of the above options are:

   • ‘always’: Always use the set of arguments that is currently active
     in the respective buffer, provided that buffer exists of course.
   • ‘selected’ or ‘t’: Use the set of arguments from the respective
     buffer, but only if it is displayed in a window of the current
     frame.  This is the default for both variables.
   • ‘current’: Use the set of arguments from the respective buffer, but
     only if it is the current buffer.
   • ‘never’: Never use the set of arguments from the respective buffer.

I am afraid it gets more complicated still:

   • The global diff and log arguments are set for each supported mode
     individually.  The diff arguments for example have different values
     in ‘magit-diff-mode’, ‘magit-revision-mode’,
     ‘magit-merge-preview-mode’ and ‘magit-status-mode’ buffers.
     Setting or saving the value for one mode does not change the value
     for other modes.  The history however is shared.

   • When ‘magit-show-commit’ is invoked directly from a log buffer,
     then the file filter is picked up from that buffer, not from the
     revision buffer or the mode’s global diff arguments.

   • Even though they are suffixes of the diff prefix
     ‘magit-show-commit’ and ‘magit-stash-show’ do not use the diff
     buffer used by the diff commands, instead they use the dedicated
     revision and stash buffers.

     At the time you invoke the diff prefix it is unknown to Magit which
     of the suffix commands you are going to invoke.  While not certain,
     more often than not users invoke one of the commands that use the
     diff buffer, so the initial infix arguments are those used in that
     buffer.  However if you invoke one of these commands directly, then
     Magit knows that it should use the arguments from the revision
     resp.  stash buffer.

   • The log prefix also features reflog commands, but these commands do
     not use the log arguments.

   • If ‘magit-show-refs’ is invoked from a ‘magit-refs-mode’ buffer,
     then it acts as a refresh prefix and therefore unconditionally uses
     the buffer’s arguments as initial arguments.  If it is invoked
     elsewhere with a prefix argument, then it acts as regular prefix
     and therefore respects ‘magit-prefix-use-buffer-arguments’.  If it
     is invoked elsewhere without a prefix argument, then it acts as a
     direct command and therefore respects
     ‘magit-direct-use-buffer-arguments’.

4.5.1 Action Confirmation
-------------------------

By default many actions that could potentially lead to data loss have to
be confirmed.  This includes many very common actions, so this can
quickly become annoying.  Many of these actions can be undone and if you
have thought about how to undo certain mistakes, then it should be safe
to disable confirmation for the respective actions.

   The option ‘magit-no-confirm’ can be used to tell Magit to perform
certain actions without the user having to confirm them.  Note that
while this option can only be used to disable confirmation for a
specific set of actions, the next section explains another way of
telling Magit to ask fewer questions.

 -- User Option: magit-no-confirm
     The value of this option is a list of symbols, representing actions
     that do not have to be confirmed by the user before being carried
     out.

     By default many potentially dangerous commands ask the user for
     confirmation.  Each of the below symbols stands for an action
     which, when invoked unintentionally or without being fully aware of
     the consequences, could lead to tears.  In many cases there are
     several commands that perform variations of a certain action, so we
     don’t use the command names but more generic symbols.

        • Applying changes:

             • ‘discard’ Discarding one or more changes (i.e., hunks or
               the complete diff for a file) loses that change,
               obviously.

             • ‘reverse’ Reverting one or more changes can usually be
               undone by reverting the reversion.

             • ‘stage-all-changes’, ‘unstage-all-changes’ When there are
               both staged and unstaged changes, then un-/staging
               everything would destroy that distinction.  Of course
               that also applies when un-/staging a single change, but
               then less is lost and one does that so often that having
               to confirm every time would be unacceptable.

        • Files:

             • ‘delete’ When a file that isn’t yet tracked by Git is
               deleted, then it is completely lost, not just the last
               changes.  Very dangerous.

             • ‘trash’ Instead of deleting a file it can also be move to
               the system trash.  Obviously much less dangerous than
               deleting it.

               Also see option ‘magit-delete-by-moving-to-trash’.

             • ‘resurrect’ A deleted file can easily be resurrected by
               "deleting" the deletion, which is done using the same
               command that was used to delete the same file in the
               first place.

             • ‘untrack’ Untracking a file can be undone by tracking it
               again.

             • ‘rename’ Renaming a file can easily be undone.

        • Sequences:

             • ‘reset-bisect’ Aborting (known to Git as "resetting") a
               bisect operation loses all information collected so far.

             • ‘abort-cherry-pick’ Aborting a cherry-pick throws away
               all conflict resolutions which has already been carried
               out by the user.

             • ‘abort-revert’ Aborting a revert throws away all conflict
               resolutions which has already been carried out by the
               user.

             • ‘abort-rebase’ Aborting a rebase throws away all already
               modified commits, but it’s possible to restore those from
               the reflog.

             • ‘abort-merge’ Aborting a merge throws away all conflict
               resolutions which have already been carried out by the
               user.

             • ‘merge-dirty’ Merging with a dirty worktree can make it
               hard to go back to the state before the merge was
               initiated.

        • References:

             • ‘delete-unmerged-branch’ Once a branch has been deleted,
               it can only be restored using low-level recovery tools
               provided by Git.  And even then the reflog is gone.  The
               user always has to confirm the deletion of a branch by
               accepting the default choice (or selecting another
               branch), but when a branch has not been merged yet, also
               make sure the user is aware of that.

             • ‘delete-pr-remote’ When deleting a branch that was
               created from a pull-request and if no other branches
               still exist on that remote, then ‘magit-branch-delete’
               offers to delete the remote as well.  This should be safe
               because it only happens if no other refs exist in the
               remotes namespace, and you can recreate the remote if
               necessary.

             • ‘drop-stashes’ Dropping a stash is dangerous because Git
               stores stashes in the reflog.  Once a stash is removed,
               there is no going back without using low-level recovery
               tools provided by Git.  When a single stash is dropped,
               then the user always has to confirm by accepting the
               default (or selecting another).  This action only
               concerns the deletion of multiple stashes at once.

        • Publishing:

             • ‘set-and-push’ When pushing to the upstream or the
               push-remote and that isn’t actually configured yet, then
               the user can first set the target.  If s/he confirms the
               default too quickly, then s/he might end up pushing to
               the wrong branch and if the remote repository is
               configured to disallow fixing such mistakes, then that
               can be quite embarrassing and annoying.

        • Edit published history:

          Without adding these symbols here, you will be warned before
          editing commits that have already been pushed to one of the
          branches listed in ‘magit-published-branches’.

             • ‘amend-published’ Affects most commands that amend to
               "HEAD".

             • ‘rebase-published’ Affects commands that perform
               interactive rebases.  This includes commands from the
               commit transient that modify a commit other than "HEAD",
               namely the various fixup and squash variants.

             • ‘edit-published’ Affects the commands
               ‘magit-edit-line-commit’ and
               ‘magit-diff-edit-hunk-commit’.  These two commands make
               it quite easy to accidentally edit a published commit, so
               you should think twice before configuring them not to ask
               for confirmation.

          To disable confirmation completely, add all three symbols here
          or set ‘magit-published-branches’ to ‘nil’.

        • Various:

             • ‘stash-apply-3way’ When a stash cannot be applied using
               ‘git stash apply’, then Magit uses ‘git apply’ instead,
               possibly using the ‘--3way’ argument, which isn’t always
               perfectly safe.  See also ‘magit-stash-apply’.

             • ‘kill-process’ There seldom is a reason to kill a
               process.

        • Global settings:

          Instead of adding all of the above symbols to the value of
          this option, you can also set it to the atom ‘t’, which has
          the same effect as adding all of the above symbols.  Doing
          that most certainly is a bad idea, especially because other
          symbols might be added in the future.  So even if you don’t
          want to be asked for confirmation for any of these actions,
          you are still better of adding all of the respective symbols
          individually.

          When ‘magit-wip-before-change-mode’ is enabled, then the
          following actions can be undone fairly easily: ‘discard’,
          ‘reverse’, ‘stage-all-changes’, and ‘unstage-all-changes’.  If
          and only if this mode is enabled, then ‘safe-with-wip’ has the
          same effect as adding all of these symbols individually.


File: magit.info,  Node: Completion and Confirmation,  Next: The Selection,  Prev: Action Confirmation,  Up: Completion Confirmation and the Selection

4.5.2 Completion and Confirmation
---------------------------------

Many Magit commands ask the user to select from a list of possible
things to act on, while offering the most likely choice as the default.
For many of these commands the default is the thing at point, provided
that it actually is a valid thing to act on.  For many commands that act
on a branch, the current branch serves as the default if there is no
branch at point.

   These commands combine asking for confirmation and asking for a
target to act on into a single action.  The user can confirm the default
target using ‘RET’ or abort using ‘C-g’.  This is similar to a
‘y-or-n-p’ prompt, but the keys to confirm or abort differ.

   At the same time the user is also given the opportunity to select
another target, which is useful because for some commands and/or in some
situations you might want to select the action before selecting the
target by moving to it.

   However you might find that for some commands you always want to use
the default target, if any, or even that you want the command to act on
the default without requiring any confirmation at all.  The option
‘magit-dwim-selection’ can be used to configure certain commands to that
effect.

   Note that when the region is active then many commands act on the
things that are selected using a mechanism based on the region, in many
cases after asking for confirmation.  This region-based mechanism is
called the "selection" and is described in detail in the next section.
When a selection exists that is valid for the invoked command, then that
command never offers to act on something else, and whether it asks for
confirmation is not controlled by this option.

   Also note that Magit asks for confirmation of certain actions that
are not coupled with completion (or the selection).  Such dialogs are
also not affected by this option and are described in the previous
section.

 -- User Option: magit-dwim-selection
   This option can be used to tell certain commands to use the thing at
point instead of asking the user to select a candidate to act on, with
or without confirmation.

   The value has the form ‘((COMMAND nil|PROMPT DEFAULT)...)’.

   • COMMAND is the command that should not prompt for a choice.  To
     have an effect, the command has to use the function
     ‘magit-completing-read’ or a utility function which in turn uses
     that function.

   • If the command uses ‘magit-completing-read’ multiple times, then
     PROMPT can be used to only affect one of these uses.  PROMPT, if
     non-nil, is a regular expression that is used to match against the
     PROMPT argument passed to ‘magit-completing-read’.

   • DEFAULT specifies how to use the default.  If it is ‘t’, then the
     DEFAULT argument passed to ‘magit-completing-read’ is used without
     confirmation.  If it is ‘ask’, then the user is given a chance to
     abort.  DEFAULT can also be ‘nil’, in which case the entry has no
     effect.


File: magit.info,  Node: The Selection,  Next: The hunk-internal region,  Prev: Completion and Confirmation,  Up: Completion Confirmation and the Selection

4.5.3 The Selection
-------------------

If the region is active, then many Magit commands act on the things that
are selected using a mechanism based on the region instead of one single
thing.  When the region is not active, then these commands act on the
thing at point or read a single thing to act on.  This is described in
the previous section — this section only covers how multiple things are
selected, how that is visualized, and how certain commands behave when
that is the case.

   Magit’s mechanism for selecting multiple things, or rather sections
that represent these things, is based on the Emacs region, but the area
that Magit considers to be selected is typically larger than the region
and additional restrictions apply.

   Magit makes a distinction between a region that qualifies as forming
a valid Magit selection and a region that does not.  If the region does
not qualify, then it is displayed as it is in other Emacs buffers.  If
the region does qualify as a Magit selection, then the selection is
always visualized, while the region itself is only visualized if it
begins and ends on the same line.

   For a region to qualify as a Magit selection, it must begin in the
heading of one section and end in the heading of a sibling section.
Note that if the end of the region is at the very beginning of section
heading (i.e., at the very beginning of a line) then that section is
considered to be *inside* the selection.

   This is not consistent with how the region is normally treated in
Emacs — if the region ends at the beginning of a line, then that line is
outside the region.  Due to how Magit visualizes the selection, it
should be obvious that this difference exists.

   Not every command acts on every valid selection.  Some commands do
not even consider the location of point, others may act on the section
at point but not support acting on the selection, and even commands that
do support the selection of course only do so if it selects things that
they can act on.

   This is the main reason why the selection must include the section at
point.  Even if a selection exists, the invoked command may disregard
it, in which case it may act on the current section only.  It is much
safer to only act on the current section but not the other selected
sections than it is to act on the current section *instead* of the
selected sections.  The latter would be much more surprising and if the
current section always is part of the selection, then that cannot
happen.

 -- Variable: magit-keep-region-overlay
     This variable controls whether the region is visualized as usual
     even when a valid Magit selection or a hunk-internal region exists.
     See the doc-string for more information.

4.5.4 The hunk-internal region
------------------------------

Somewhat related to the Magit selection described in the previous
section is the hunk-internal region.

   Like the selection, the hunk-internal region is based on the Emacs
region but causes that region to not be visualized as it would in other
Emacs buffers, and includes the line on which the region ends even if it
ends at the very beginning of that line.

   Unlike the selection, which is based on a region that must begin in
the heading of one section and ends in the section of a sibling section,
the hunk-internal region must begin inside the *body* of a hunk section
and end in the body of the *same* section.

   The hunk-internal region is honored by "apply" commands, which can,
among other targets, act on a hunk.  If the hunk-internal region is
active, then such commands act only on the marked part of the hunk
instead of on the complete hunk.


File: magit.info,  Node: Support for Completion Frameworks,  Next: Additional Completion Options,  Prev: The hunk-internal region,  Up: Completion Confirmation and the Selection

4.5.5 Support for Completion Frameworks
---------------------------------------

The built-in option ‘completing-read-function’ specifies the low-level
function used by ‘completing-read’ to ask a user to select from a list
of choices.  Its default value is ‘completing-read-default’.
Alternative completion frameworks typically activate themselves by
substituting their own implementation.

   Mostly for historic reasons Magit provides a similar option named
‘magit-completing-read-function’, which only controls the low-level
function used by ‘magit-completing-read’.  This option also makes it
possible to use a different completing mechanism for Magit than for the
rest of Emacs, but doing that is not recommend.

   You most likely don’t have to customize the magit-specific option to
use an alternative completion framework.  For example, if you enable
‘ivy-mode’, then Magit will respect that, and if you enable ‘helm-mode’,
then you are done too.

   However if you want to use Ido, then ‘ido-mode’ won’t do the trick.
You will also have to install the ‘ido-completing-read+’ package and use
‘magit-ido-completing-read’ as ‘magit-completing-read-function’.

 -- User Option: magit-completing-read-function
     The value of this variable is the low-level function used to
     perform completion by code that uses ‘magit-completing-read’ (as
     opposed to the built-in ‘completing-read’).

     The default value, ‘magit-builtin-completing-read’, is suitable for
     the standard completion mechanism, ‘ivy-mode’, and ‘helm-mode’ at
     least.

     The built-in ‘completing-read’ and ‘completing-read-default’ are
     *not* suitable to be used here.  ‘magit-builtin-completing-read’
     performs some additional work, and any function used in its place
     has to do the same.

 -- Function: magit-builtin-completing-read prompt choices &optional
          predicate require-match initial-input hist def
     This function performs completion using the built-in
     ‘completing-read’ and does some additional magit-specific work.

 -- Function: magit-ido-completing-read prompt choices &optional
          predicate require-match initial-input hist def
     This function performs completion using ‘ido-completing-read+’ from
     the package by the same name (which you have to explicitly install)
     and does some additional magit-specific work.

     We have to use ‘ido-completing-read+’ instead of the
     ‘ido-completing-read’ that comes with Ido itself, because the
     latter, while intended as a drop-in replacement, cannot serve that
     purpose because it violates too many of the implicit conventions.

 -- Function: magit-completing-read prompt choices &optional predicate
          require-match initial-input hist def fallback
     This is the function that Magit commands use when they need the
     user to select a single thing to act on.  The arguments have the
     same meaning as for ‘completing-read’, except for FALLBACK, which
     is unique to this function and is described below.

     Instead of asking the user to choose from a list of possible
     candidates, this function may just return the default specified by
     DEF, with or without requiring user confirmation.  Whether that is
     the case depends on PROMPT, ‘this-command’ and
     ‘magit-dwim-selection’.  See the documentation of the latter for
     more information.

     If it does read a value in the minibuffer, then this function acts
     similar to ‘completing-read’, except for the following:

        • COLLECTION must be a list of choices.  A function is not
          supported.

        • If REQUIRE-MATCH is ‘nil’ and the user exits without a choice,
          then ‘nil’ is returned instead of an empty string.

        • If REQUIRE-MATCH is non-nil and the users exits without a
          choice, an user-error is raised.

        • FALLBACK specifies a secondary default that is only used if
          the primary default DEF is ‘nil’.  The secondary default is
          not subject to ‘magit-dwim-selection’ — if DEF is ‘nil’ but
          FALLBACK is not, then this function always asks the user to
          choose a candidate, just as if both defaults were ‘nil’.

        • ": " is appended to PROMPT.

        • PROMPT is modified to end with \" (default DEF|FALLBACK): \"
          provided that DEF or FALLBACK is non-nil, that neither
          ‘ivy-mode’ nor ‘helm-mode’ is enabled, and that
          ‘magit-completing-read-function’ is set to its default value
          of ‘magit-builtin-completing-read’.

4.5.6 Additional Completion Options
-----------------------------------

 -- User Option: magit-list-refs-sortby
     For many commands that read a ref or refs from the user, the value
     of this option can be used to control the order of the refs.  Valid
     values include any key accepted by the ‘--sort’ flag of ‘git
     for-each-ref’.  By default, refs are sorted alphabetically by their
     full name (e.g., "refs/heads/master").

File: magit.info,  Node: Viewing Git Output,  Next: Git Process Status,  Up: Running Git

4.7.1 Viewing Git Output
------------------------

Magit runs Git either for side-effects (e.g., when pushing) or to get
some value (e.g., the name of the current branch).

   When Git is run for side-effects, the process output is logged in a
per-repository log buffer, which can be consulted using the
‘magit-process’ command when things don’t go as expected.

   The output/errors for up to ‘magit-process-log-max’ Git commands are
retained.

‘$’ (‘magit-process’)
     This commands displays the process buffer for the current
     repository.

   Inside that buffer, the usual key bindings for navigating and showing
sections are available.  There is one additional command.

‘k’ (‘magit-process-kill’)
     This command kills the process represented by the section at point.

 -- Variable: magit-git-debug
     This option controls whether additional reporting of git errors is
     enabled.

     Magit basically calls git for one of these two reasons: for
     side-effects or to do something with its standard output.

     When git is run for side-effects then its output, including error
     messages, go into the process buffer which is shown when using ‘$’.

     When git’s output is consumed in some way, then it would be too
     expensive to also insert it into this buffer, but when this option
     is non-nil and git returns with a non-zero exit status, then at
     least its standard error is inserted into this buffer.

     This is only intended for debugging purposes.  Do not enable this
     permanently, that would negatively affect performance.

     This is only intended for debugging purposes.  Do not enable this
     permanently, that would negatively affect performance.  Also note
     that just because git exits with a non-zero exit status and prints
     an error message that usually doesn’t mean that it is an error as
     far as Magit is concerned, which is another reason we usually hide
     these error messages.  Whether some error message is relevant in
     the context of some unexpected behavior has to be judged on a case
     by case basis.

     The command ‘magit-toggle-git-debug’ changes the value of this
     variable.

 -- Variable: magit-process-extreme-logging
     This option controls whether ‘magit-process-file’ logs to the
     ‘*Messages*’ buffer.

     Only intended for temporary use when you try to figure out how
     Magit uses Git behind the scene.  Output that normally goes to the
     magit-process buffer continues to go there.  Not all output goes to
     either of these two buffers.


File: magit.info,  Node: Git Process Status,  Next: Running Git Manually,  Prev: Viewing Git Output,  Up: Running Git

4.7.2 Git Process Status
------------------------

When a Git process is running for side-effects, Magit displays an
indicator in the mode line, using the ‘magit-mode-line-process’ face.

   If the Git process exits successfully, the process indicator is
removed from the mode line immediately.

   In the case of a Git error, the process indicator is not removed, but
is instead highlighted with the ‘magit-mode-line-process-error’ face,
and the error details from the process buffer are provided as a tooltip
for mouse users.  This error indicator persists in the mode line until
the next magit buffer refresh.

   If you do not wish process errors to be indicated in the mode line,
customize the ‘magit-process-display-mode-line-error’ user option.

   Process errors are additionally indicated at the top of the status
buffer.


File: magit.info,  Node: Running Git Manually,  Next: Git Executable,  Prev: Git Process Status,  Up: Running Git

4.7.3 Running Git Manually
--------------------------

While Magit provides many Emacs commands to interact with Git, it does
not cover everything.  In those cases your existing Git knowledge will
come in handy.  Magit provides some commands for running arbitrary Git
commands by typing them into the minibuffer, instead of having to switch
to a shell.

‘!’ (‘magit-run’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     and displays them in a temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

‘! !’ (‘magit-git-command-topdir’)
     This command reads a command from the user and executes it in the
     top-level directory of the current working tree.

     The string "git " is used as initial input when prompting the user
     for the command.  It can be removed to run another command.

‘:’ (‘magit-git-command’)
‘! p’
     This command reads a command from the user and executes it in
     ‘default-directory’.  With a prefix argument the command is
     executed in the top-level directory of the current working tree
     instead.

     The string "git " is used as initial input when prompting the user
     for the command.  It can be removed to run another command.

‘! s’ (‘magit-shell-command-topdir’)
     This command reads a command from the user and executes it in the
     top-level directory of the current working tree.

‘! S’ (‘magit-shell-command’)
     This command reads a command from the user and executes it in
     ‘default-directory’.  With a prefix argument the command is
     executed in the top-level directory of the current working tree
     instead.

 -- User Option: magit-shell-command-verbose-prompt
     Whether the prompt, used by the above commands when reading a shell
     command, shows the directory in which it will be run.

   These suffix commands start external gui tools.

‘! k’ (‘magit-run-gitk’)
     This command runs ‘gitk’ in the current repository.

‘! a’ (‘magit-run-gitk-all’)
     This command runs ‘gitk --all’ in the current repository.

‘! b’ (‘magit-run-gitk-branches’)
     This command runs ‘gitk --branches’ in the current repository.

‘! g’ (‘magit-run-git-gui’)
     This command runs ‘git gui’ in the current repository.

‘! m’ (‘magit-git-mergetool’)
     This command runs ‘git mergetool --gui’ in the current repository.

     With a prefix argument this acts as a transient prefix command,
     allowing the user to select the mergetool and change some settings.


File: magit.info,  Node: Git Executable,  Next: Global Git Arguments,  Prev: Running Git Manually,  Up: Running Git

4.7.4 Git Executable
--------------------

When Magit calls Git, then it may do so using the absolute path to the
‘git’ executable, or using just its name.

   When running ‘git’ locally and the ‘system-type’ is ‘windows-nt’ (any
Windows version) or ‘darwin’ (macOS) then ‘magit-git-executable’ is set
to an absolute path when Magit is loaded.

   On Windows it is necessary to use an absolute path because Git comes
with several wrapper scripts for the actual ‘git’ binary, which are also
placed on ‘$PATH’, and using one of these wrappers instead of the binary
would degrade performance horribly.  For some macOS users using just the
name of the executable also performs horribly, so we avoid doing that on
that platform as well.  On other platforms, using just the name seems to
work just fine.

   Using an absolute path when running ‘git’ on a remote machine over
Tramp, would be problematic to use an absolute path that is suitable on
the local machine, so a separate option is used to control the name or
path that is used on remote machines.

 -- User Option: magit-git-executable
     The ‘git’ executable used by Magit on the local host.  This should
     be either the absolute path to the executable, or the string "git"
     to let Emacs find the executable itself, using the standard
     mechanism for doing such things.

 -- User Option: magit-remote-git-executable
     The ‘git’ executable used by Magit on remote machines over Tramp.
     Normally this should be just the string "git".  Consider
     customizing ‘tramp-remote-path’ instead of this option.

   If Emacs is unable to find the correct executable, then you can work
around that by explicitly setting the value of one of these two options.
Doing that should be considered a kludge; it is better to make sure that
the order in ‘exec-path’ or ‘tramp-remote-path’ is correct.

   Note that ‘exec-path’ is set based on the value of the ‘PATH’
environment variable that is in effect when Emacs is started.  If you
set ‘PATH’ in your shell’s init files, then that only has an effect on
Emacs if you start it from that shell (because the environment of a
process is only passed to its child processes, not to arbitrary other
processes).  If that is not how you start Emacs, then the
‘exec-path-from-shell’ package can help; though honestly I consider that
a kludge too.

   The command ‘magit-debug-git-executable’ can be useful to find out
where Emacs is searching for ‘git’.

‘M-x magit-debug-git-executable’
     This command displays a buffer with information about
     ‘magit-git-executable’ and ‘magit-remote-git-executable’.

‘M-x magit-version’
     This command shows the currently used versions of Magit, Git, and
     Emacs in the echo area.  Non-interactively this just returns the
     Magit version.


File: magit.info,  Node: Global Git Arguments,  Prev: Git Executable,  Up: Running Git

4.7.5 Global Git Arguments
--------------------------

 -- User Option: magit-git-global-arguments
     The arguments set here are used every time the git executable is
     run as a subprocess.  They are placed right after the executable
     itself and before the git command - as in ‘git HERE... COMMAND
     REST’.  For valid arguments see *note (gitman)git::.

     Be careful what you add here, especially if you are using Tramp to
     connect to servers with ancient Git versions.  Never remove
     anything that is part of the default value, unless you really know
     what you are doing.  And think very hard before adding something;
     it will be used every time Magit runs Git for any purpose.


File: magit.info,  Node: Inspecting,  Next: Manipulating,  Prev: Interface Concepts,  Up: Top

5 Inspecting
************

The functionality provided by Magit can be roughly divided into three
groups: inspecting existing data, manipulating existing data or adding
new data, and transferring data.  Of course that is a rather crude
distinction that often falls short, but it’s more useful than no
distinction at all.  This section is concerned with inspecting data, the
next two with manipulating and transferring it.  Then follows a section
about miscellaneous functionality, which cannot easily be fit into this
distinction.

   Of course other distinctions make sense too, e.g., Git’s distinction
between porcelain and plumbing commands, which for the most part is
equivalent to Emacs’ distinction between interactive commands and
non-interactive functions.  All of the sections mentioned before are
mainly concerned with the porcelain – Magit’s plumbing layer is
described later.

File: magit.info,  Node: Status Buffer,  Next: Repository List,  Up: Inspecting

5.1 Status Buffer
=================

While other Magit buffers contain, e.g., one particular diff or one
particular log, the status buffer contains the diffs for staged and
unstaged changes, logs for unpushed and unpulled commits, lists of
stashes and untracked files, and information related to the current
branch.

   During certain incomplete operations – for example when a merge
resulted in a conflict – additional information is displayed that helps
proceeding with or aborting the operation.

   The command ‘magit-status’ displays the status buffer belonging to
the current repository in another window.  This command is used so often
that it should be bound globally.  We recommend using ‘C-x g’:

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-x g") 'magit-status)

‘C-x g’ (‘magit-status’)
     When invoked from within an existing Git repository, then this
     command shows the status of that repository in a buffer.

     If the current directory isn’t located within a Git repository,
     then this command prompts for an existing repository or an
     arbitrary directory, depending on the option
     ‘magit-repository-directories’, and the status for the selected
     repository is shown instead.

        • If that option specifies any existing repositories, then the
          user is asked to select one of them.

        • Otherwise the user is asked to select an arbitrary directory
          using regular file-name completion.  If the selected directory
          is the top-level directory of an existing working tree, then
          the status buffer for that is shown.

        • Otherwise the user is offered to initialize the selected
          directory as a new repository.  After creating the repository
          its status buffer is shown.

     These fallback behaviors can also be forced using one or more
     prefix arguments:

        • With two prefix arguments (or more precisely a numeric prefix
          value of 16 or greater) an arbitrary directory is read, which
          is then acted on as described above.  The same could be
          accomplished using the command ‘magit-init’.

        • With a single prefix argument an existing repository is read
          from the user, or if no repository can be found based on the
          value of ‘magit-repository-directories’, then the behavior is
          the same as with two prefix arguments.

 -- User Option: magit-repository-directories
     List of directories that are Git repositories or contain Git
     repositories.

     Each element has the form ‘(DIRECTORY . DEPTH)’.  DIRECTORY has to
     be a directory or a directory file-name, a string.  DEPTH, an
     integer, specifies the maximum depth to look for Git repositories.
     If it is 0, then only add DIRECTORY itself.

     This option controls which repositories are being listed by
     ‘magit-list-repositories’.  It also affects ‘magit-status’ (which
     see) in potentially surprising ways (see above).

 -- Command: magit-status-quick
     This command is an alternative to ‘magit-status’ that usually
     avoids refreshing the status buffer.

     If the status buffer of the current Git repository exists but isn’t
     being displayed in the selected frame, then it is displayed without
     being refreshed.

     If the status buffer is being displayed in the selected frame, then
     this command refreshes it.

     Prefix arguments have the same meaning as for ‘magit-status’, and
     additionally cause the buffer to be refresh.

     To use this command add this to your init file:

          (global-set-key (kbd "C-x g") 'magit-status-quick).

     If you do that and then for once want to redisplay the buffer and
     also immediately refresh it, then type ‘C-x g’ followed by ‘g’.

     A possible alternative command is
     ‘magit-display-repository-buffer’.  It supports displaying any
     existing Magit buffer that belongs to the current repository; not
     just the status buffer.

 -- Command: ido-enter-magit-status
     From an Ido prompt used to open a file, instead drop into
     ‘magit-status’.  This is similar to ‘ido-magic-delete-char’, which,
     despite its name, usually causes a Dired buffer to be created.

     To make this command available, use something like:

          (add-hook 'ido-setup-hook
                    (lambda ()
                      (define-key ido-completion-map
                        (kbd \"C-x g\") 'ido-enter-magit-status)))

     Starting with Emacs 25.1 the Ido keymaps are defined just once
     instead of every time Ido is invoked, so now you can modify it like
     pretty much every other keymap:

          (define-key ido-common-completion-map
            (kbd \"C-x g\") 'ido-enter-magit-status)

‘magit-insert-status-headers’; it is described in the next section.  By
default the following functions are also members of that hook:

 -- Function: magit-insert-untracked-files
     Maybe insert a list or tree of untracked files.

     Do so depending on the value of ‘status.showUntrackedFiles’.  Note
     that even if the value is ‘all’, Magit still initially only shows
     directories.  But the directory sections can then be expanded using
     ‘TAB’.

 -- Function: magit-insert-unstaged-changes
     Insert section showing unstaged changes.

 -- Function: magit-insert-staged-changes
     Insert section showing staged changes.

 -- Function: magit-insert-stashes &optional ref heading
     Insert the ‘stashes’ section showing reflog for "refs/stash".  If
     optional REF is non-nil show reflog for that instead.  If optional
     HEADING is non-nil use that as section heading instead of
     "Stashes:".

 -- Function: magit-insert-unpulled-from-upstream
     Insert section showing commits that haven’t been pulled from the
     upstream branch yet.

 -- Function: magit-insert-unpulled-from-pushremote
     Insert section showing commits that haven’t been pulled from the
     push-remote branch yet.

 -- Function: magit-insert-unpushed-to-upstream
     Insert section showing commits that haven’t been pushed to the
     upstream yet.

 -- Function: magit-insert-unpushed-to-pushremote
     Insert section showing commits that haven’t been pushed to the
     push-remote yet.

   The following functions can also be added to the above hook:

 -- Function: magit-insert-tracked-files
     Insert a tree of tracked files.

 -- Function: magit-insert-ignored-files
     Insert a tree of ignored files.  Its possible to limit the logs in
     the current buffer to a certain directory using ‘D = f <DIRECTORY>
     RET g’.  If you do that, then that that also affects this command.

     The log filter can be used to limit to multiple files.  In that
     case this function only respects the first of the files and only if
     it is a directory.

 -- Function: magit-insert-skip-worktree-files
     Insert a tree of skip-worktree files.  If the first element of
     ‘magit-buffer-diff-files’ is a directory, then limit the list to
     files below that.  The value of that variable can be set using ‘D
     -- DIRECTORY RET g’.

 -- Function: magit-insert-assumed-unchanged-files
     Insert a tree of files that are assumed to be unchanged.  If the
     first element of ‘magit-buffer-diff-files’ is a directory, then
     limit the list to files below that.  The value of that variable can
     be set using ‘D -- DIRECTORY RET g’.

 -- Function: magit-insert-unpulled-or-recent-commits
     Insert section showing unpulled or recent commits.  If an upstream
     is configured for the current branch and it is ahead of the current
     branch, then show the missing commits.  Otherwise, show the last
     ‘magit-log-section-commit-count’ commits.

 -- Function: magit-insert-recent-commits
     Insert section showing the last ‘magit-log-section-commit-count’
     commits.

 -- User Option: magit-log-section-commit-count
     How many recent commits ‘magit-insert-recent-commits’ and
     ‘magit-insert-unpulled-or-recent-commits’ (provided there are no
     unpulled commits) show.

 -- Function: magit-insert-unpulled-cherries
     Insert section showing unpulled commits.  Like
     ‘magit-insert-unpulled-commits’ but prefix each commit that has not
     been applied yet (i.e., a commit with a patch-id not shared with
     any local commit) with "+", and all others with "-".

 -- Function: magit-insert-unpushed-cherries
     Insert section showing unpushed commits.  Like
     ‘magit-insert-unpushed-commits’ but prefix each commit which has
     not been applied to upstream yet (i.e., a commit with a patch-id
     not shared with any upstream commit) with "+" and all others with
     "-".

   See *note References Buffer:: for some more section inserters, which
could be used here.


File: magit.info,  Node: Status Header Sections,  Next: Status Module Sections,  Prev: Status Sections,  Up: Status Buffer

5.1.2 Status Header Sections
----------------------------

The contents of status buffers is controlled using the hook
‘magit-status-sections-hook’ (see *note Status Sections::).

   By default ‘magit-insert-status-headers’ is the first member of that
hook variable.

 -- Function: magit-insert-status-headers
     Insert headers sections appropriate for ‘magit-status-mode’
     buffers.  The sections are inserted by running the functions on the
     hook ‘magit-status-headers-hook’.

 -- User Option: magit-status-headers-hook
     Hook run to insert headers sections into the status buffer.

     This hook is run by ‘magit-insert-status-headers’, which in turn
     has to be a member of ‘magit-status-sections-hook’ to be used at
     all.

   By default the following functions are members of the above hook:

 -- Function: magit-insert-error-header
     Insert a header line showing the message about the Git error that
     just occurred.

     This function is only aware of the last error that occur when Git
     was run for side-effects.  If, for example, an error occurs while
     generating a diff, then that error won’t be inserted.  Refreshing
     the status buffer causes this section to disappear again.

 -- Function: magit-insert-diff-filter-header
     Insert a header line showing the effective diff filters.

 -- Function: magit-insert-head-branch-header
     Insert a header line about the current branch or detached ‘HEAD’.

 -- Function: magit-insert-upstream-branch-header
     Insert a header line about the branch that is usually pulled into
     the current branch.

 -- Function: magit-insert-push-branch-header
     Insert a header line about the branch that the current branch is
     usually pushed to.

 -- Function: magit-insert-tags-header
     Insert a header line about the current and/or next tag, along with
     the number of commits between the tag and ‘HEAD’.

   The following functions can also be added to the above hook:

 -- Function: magit-insert-repo-header
     Insert a header line showing the path to the repository top-level.

 -- Function: magit-insert-remote-header
     Insert a header line about the remote of the current branch.

     If no remote is configured for the current branch, then fall back
     showing the "origin" remote, or if that does not exist the first
     remote in alphabetic order.

 -- Function: magit-insert-user-header
     Insert a header line about the current user.


File: magit.info,  Node: Status Module Sections,  Next: Status Options,  Prev: Status Header Sections,  Up: Status Buffer

5.1.3 Status Module Sections
----------------------------

The contents of status buffers is controlled using the hook
‘magit-status-sections-hook’ (see *note Status Sections::).

   By default ‘magit-insert-modules’ is _not_ a member of that hook
variable.

 -- Function: magit-insert-modules
     Insert submodule sections.

     Hook ‘magit-module-sections-hook’ controls which module sections
     are inserted, and option ‘magit-module-sections-nested’ controls
     whether they are wrapped in an additional section.

 -- User Option: magit-module-sections-hook
     Hook run by ‘magit-insert-modules’.

 -- User Option: magit-module-sections-nested
     This option controls whether ‘magit-insert-modules’ wraps inserted
     sections in an additional section.

     If this is non-nil, then only a single top-level section is
     inserted.  If it is nil, then all sections listed in
     ‘magit-module-sections-hook’ become top-level sections.

 -- Function: magit-insert-modules-overview
     Insert sections for all submodules.  For each section insert the
     path, the branch, and the output of ‘git describe --tags’, or,
     failing that, the abbreviated HEAD commit hash.

     Press ‘RET’ on such a submodule section to show its own status
     buffer.  Press ‘RET’ on the "Modules" section to display a list of
     submodules in a separate buffer.  This shows additional information
     not displayed in the super-repository’s status buffer.

 -- Function: magit-insert-modules-unpulled-from-upstream
     Insert sections for modules that haven’t been pulled from the
     upstream yet.  These sections can be expanded to show the
     respective commits.

 -- Function: magit-insert-modules-unpulled-from-pushremote
     Insert sections for modules that haven’t been pulled from the
     push-remote yet.  These sections can be expanded to show the
     respective commits.

 -- Function: magit-insert-modules-unpushed-to-upstream
     Insert sections for modules that haven’t been pushed to the
     upstream yet.  These sections can be expanded to show the
     respective commits.

 -- Function: magit-insert-modules-unpushed-to-pushremote
     Insert sections for modules that haven’t been pushed to the
     push-remote yet.  These sections can be expanded to show the
     respective commits.


File: magit.info,  Node: Status Options,  Prev: Status Module Sections,  Up: Status Buffer

5.1.4 Status Options
--------------------

 -- User Option: magit-status-refresh-hook
     Hook run after a status buffer has been refreshed.

 -- User Option: magit-status-margin
     This option specifies whether the margin is initially shown in
     Magit-Status mode buffers and how it is formatted.

     The value has the form ‘(INIT STYLE WIDTH AUTHOR AUTHOR-WIDTH)’.

        • If INIT is non-nil, then the margin is shown initially.
        • STYLE controls how to format the author or committer date.  It
          can be one of ‘age’ (to show the age of the commit),
          ‘age-abbreviated’ (to abbreviate the time unit to a
          character), or a string (suitable for ‘format-time-string’) to
          show the actual date.  Option
          ‘magit-log-margin-show-committer-date’ controls which date is
          being displayed.
        • WIDTH controls the width of the margin.  This exists for
          forward compatibility and currently the value should not be
          changed.
        • AUTHOR controls whether the name of the author is also shown
          by default.
        • AUTHOR-WIDTH has to be an integer.  When the name of the
          author is shown, then this specifies how much space is used to
          do so.

   Also see the proceeding section for more options concerning status
buffers.


File: magit.info,  Node: Repository List,  Next: Logging,  Prev: Status Buffer,  Up: Inspecting

5.2 Repository List
===================

 -- Command: magit-list-repositories
     This command displays a list of repositories in a separate buffer.

     The option ‘magit-repository-directories’ controls which
     repositories are displayed.

 -- User Option: magit-repolist-columns
     This option controls what columns are displayed by the command
     ‘magit-list-repositories’ and how they are displayed.

     Each element has the form ‘(HEADER WIDTH FORMAT PROPS)’.

     HEADER is the string displayed in the header.  WIDTH is the width
     of the column.  FORMAT is a function that is called with one
     argument, the repository identification (usually its basename), and
     with ‘default-directory’ bound to the toplevel of its working tree.
     It has to return a string to be inserted or nil.  PROPS is an alist
     that supports the keys ‘:right-align’, ‘:pad-right’ and ‘:sort’.

     The ‘:sort’ function has a weird interface described in the
     docstring of ‘tabulated-list--get-sort’.  Alternatively ‘<’ and
     ‘magit-repolist-version<’ can be used as those functions are
     automatically replaced with functions that satisfy the interface.
     Set ‘:sort’ to ‘nil’ to inhibit sorting; if unspecified, then the
     column is sortable using the default sorter.

     You may wish to display a range of numeric columns using just one
     character per column and without any padding between columns, in
     which case you should use an appropriate HEADER, set WIDTH to 1,
     and set ‘:pad-right’ to 9.  ‘+’ is substituted for numbers higher
     than 9.

The following functions can be added to the above option:

 -- Function: magit-repolist-column-ident
     This function inserts the identification of the repository.
     Usually this is just its basename.

 -- Function: magit-repolist-column-path
     This function inserts the absolute path of the repository.

 -- Function: magit-repolist-column-version
     This function inserts a description of the repository’s ‘HEAD’
     revision.

 -- Function: magit-repolist-column-branch
     This function inserts the name of the current branch.

 -- Function: magit-repolist-column-upstream
     This function inserts the name of the upstream branch of the
     current branch.

 -- Function: magit-repolist-column-branches
     This function inserts the number of branches.

 -- Function: magit-repolist-column-stashes
     This function inserts the number of stashes.

 -- Function: magit-repolist-column-flag
     This function inserts a flag as specified by
     ‘magit-repolist-column-flag-alist’.

     By default this indicates whether there are uncommitted changes.

        • ‘N’ if there is at least one untracked file.
        • ‘U’ if there is at least one unstaged file.
        • ‘S’ if there is at least one staged file.

     Only the first one of these that applies is shown.

 -- Function: magit-repolist-column-flags
     This functions insert all flags as specified by
     ‘magit-repolist-column-flag-alist’.

     This is an alternative to function ‘magit-repolist-column-flag’,
     which only lists the first one found.

 -- Function: magit-repolist-column-unpulled-from-upstream
     This function inserts the number of upstream commits not in the
     current branch.

 -- Function: magit-repolist-column-unpulled-from-pushremote
     This function inserts the number of commits in the push branch but
     not the current branch.

 -- Function: magit-repolist-column-unpushed-to-upstream
     This function inserts the number of commits in the current branch
     but not its upstream.

 -- Function: magit-repolist-column-unpushed-to-pushremote
     This function inserts the number of commits in the current branch
     but not its push branch.

The following commands are available in repolist buffers:

‘<RET>’ (‘magit-repolist-status’)
     This command shows the status for the repository at point.

‘m’ (‘magit-repolist-mark’)
     This command marks the repository at point.

‘u’ (‘magit-repolist-unmark’)
     This command unmarks the repository at point.

‘f’ (‘magit-repolist-fetch’)
     This command fetches all marked repositories.  If no repositories
     are marked, then it offers to fetch all displayed repositories.

‘5’ (‘magit-repolist-find-file-other-frame’)
     This command reads a relative file-name (without completion) and
     opens the respective file in each marked repository in a new frame.
     If no repositories are marked, then it offers to do this for all
     displayed repositories.

5.3 Logging
===========

The status buffer contains logs for the unpushed and unpulled commits,
but that obviously isn’t enough.  The transient prefix command
‘magit-log’, on ‘l’, features several suffix commands, which show a
specific log in a separate log buffer.

   Like other transient prefix commands, ‘magit-log’ also features
several infix arguments that can be changed before invoking one of the
suffix commands.  However, in the case of the log transient, these
arguments may be taken from those currently in use in the current
repository’s log buffer, depending on the value of
‘magit-prefix-use-buffer-arguments’ (see *note Transient Arguments and
Buffer Variables::).

   For information about the various arguments, see *note
(gitman)git-log::.

   The switch ‘++order=VALUE’ is converted to one of
‘--author-date-order’, ‘--date-order’, or ‘--topo-order’ before being
passed to ‘git log’.

   The log transient also features several reflog commands.  See *note
Reflog::.

‘l’ (‘magit-log’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

‘l l’ (‘magit-log-current’)
     Show log for the current branch.  When ‘HEAD’ is detached or with a
     prefix argument, show log for one or more revs read from the
     minibuffer.

‘l h’ (‘magit-log-head’)
     Show log for ‘HEAD’.

‘l u’ (‘magit-log-related’)
     Show log for the current branch, its upstream and its push target.
     When the upstream is a local branch, then also show its own
     upstream.  When ‘HEAD’ is detached, then show log for that, the
     previously checked out branch and its upstream and push-target.

‘l o’ (‘magit-log-other’)
     Show log for one or more revs read from the minibuffer.  The user
     can input any revision or revisions separated by a space, or even
     ranges, but only branches, tags, and a representation of the commit
     at point are available as completion candidates.

‘l L’ (‘magit-log-branches’)
     Show log for all local branches and ‘HEAD’.

‘l b’ (‘magit-log-all-branches’)
     Show log for all local and remote branches and ‘HEAD’.

‘l a’ (‘magit-log-all’)
     Show log for all references and ‘HEAD’.

   Two additional commands that show the log for the file or blob that
is being visited in the current buffer exists, see *note Commands for
Buffers Visiting Files::.  The command ‘magit-cherry’ also shows a log,
see *note Cherries::.

5.3.1 Refreshing Logs
---------------------

The transient prefix command ‘magit-log-refresh’, on ‘L’, can be used to
change the log arguments used in the current buffer, without changing
which log is shown.  This works in dedicated log buffers, but also in
the status buffer.

‘L’ (‘magit-log-refresh’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

‘L g’ (‘magit-log-refresh’)
     This suffix command sets the local log arguments for the current
     buffer.

‘L s’ (‘magit-log-set-default-arguments’)
     This suffix command sets the default log arguments for buffers of
     the same type as that of the current buffer.  Other existing
     buffers of the same type are not affected because their local
     values have already been initialized.

‘L w’ (‘magit-log-save-default-arguments’)
     This suffix command sets the default log arguments for buffers of
     the same type as that of the current buffer, and saves the value
     for future sessions.  Other existing buffers of the same type are
     not affected because their local values have already been
     initialized.

‘L L’ (‘magit-toggle-margin’)
     Show or hide the margin.


File: magit.info,  Node: Log Buffer,  Next: Log Margin,  Prev: Refreshing Logs,  Up: Logging

5.3.2 Log Buffer
----------------

‘L’ (‘magit-log-refresh’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

     See *note Refreshing Logs::.

‘q’ (‘magit-log-bury-buffer’)
     Bury the current buffer or the revision buffer in the same frame.
     Like ‘magit-mode-bury-buffer’ (which see) but with a negative
     prefix argument instead bury the revision buffer, provided it is
     displayed in the current frame.

‘C-c C-b’ (‘magit-go-backward’)
     Move backward in current buffer’s history.

‘C-c C-f’ (‘magit-go-forward’)
     Move forward in current buffer’s history.

‘C-c C-n’ (‘magit-log-move-to-parent’)
     Move to a parent of the current commit.  By default, this is the
     first parent, but a numeric prefix can be used to specify another
     parent.

‘j’ (‘magit-log-move-to-revision’)
     Read a revision and move to it in current log buffer.

     If the chosen reference or revision isn’t being displayed in the
     current log buffer, then inform the user about that and do nothing
     else.

     If invoked outside any log buffer, then display the log buffer of
     the current repository first; creating it if necessary.

‘<SPC>’ (‘magit-diff-show-or-scroll-up’)
     Update the commit or diff buffer for the thing at point.

     Either show the commit or stash at point in the appropriate buffer,
     or if that buffer is already being displayed in the current frame
     and contains information about that commit or stash, then instead
     scroll the buffer up.  If there is no commit or stash at point,
     then prompt for a commit.

‘<DEL>’ (‘magit-diff-show-or-scroll-down’)
     Update the commit or diff buffer for the thing at point.

     Either show the commit or stash at point in the appropriate buffer,
     or if that buffer is already being displayed in the current frame
     and contains information about that commit or stash, then instead
     scroll the buffer down.  If there is no commit or stash at point,
     then prompt for a commit.

‘=’ (‘magit-log-toggle-commit-limit’)
     Toggle the number of commits the current log buffer is limited to.
     If the number of commits is currently limited, then remove that
     limit.  Otherwise set it to 256.

‘+’ (‘magit-log-double-commit-limit’)
     Double the number of commits the current log buffer is limited to.

‘-’ (‘magit-log-half-commit-limit’)
     Half the number of commits the current log buffer is limited to.

 -- User Option: magit-log-auto-more
     Insert more log entries automatically when moving past the last
     entry.  Only considered when moving past the last entry with
     ‘magit-goto-*-section’ commands.

 -- User Option: magit-log-show-refname-after-summary
     Whether to show the refnames after the commit summaries.  This is
     useful if you use really long branch names.

 -- User Option: magit-log-show-color-graph-limit
     When showing more commits than specified by this option, then the
     ‘--color’ argument, if specified, is silently dropped.  This is
     necessary because the ‘ansi-color’ library, which is used to turn
     control sequences into faces, is just too slow.

 -- User Option: magit-log-show-signatures-limit
     When showing more commits than specified by this option, then the
     ‘--show-signature’ argument, if specified, is silently dropped.
     This is necessary because checking the signature of a large number
     of commits is just too slow.

   Magit displays references in logs a bit differently from how Git does
it.

   Local branches are blue and remote branches are green.  Of course
that depends on the used theme, as do the colors used for other types of
references.  The current branch has a box around it, as do remote
branches that are their respective remote’s ‘HEAD’ branch.

   If a local branch and its push-target point at the same commit, then
their names are combined to preserve space and to make that relationship
visible.  For example:

     origin/feature
     [green][blue-]

     instead of

     feature origin/feature
     [blue-] [green-------]

   Also note that while the transient features the ‘--show-signature’
argument, that won’t actually be used when enabled, because Magit
defaults to use just one line per commit.  Instead the commit colorized
to indicate the validity of the signed commit object, using the faces
named ‘magit-signature-*’ (which see).

   For a description of ‘magit-log-margin’ see *note Log Margin::.


File: magit.info,  Node: Log Margin,  Next: Select from Log,  Prev: Log Buffer,  Up: Logging

5.3.3 Log Margin
----------------

In buffers which show one or more logs, it is possible to show
additional information about each commit in the margin.  The options
used to configure the margin are named ‘magit-INFIX-margin’, where INFIX
is the same as in the respective major-mode ‘magit-INFIX-mode’.  In
regular log buffers that would be ‘magit-log-margin’.

 -- User Option: magit-log-margin
     This option specifies whether the margin is initially shown in
     Magit-Log mode buffers and how it is formatted.

     The value has the form ‘(INIT STYLE WIDTH AUTHOR AUTHOR-WIDTH)’.

        • If INIT is non-nil, then the margin is shown initially.
        • STYLE controls how to format the author or committer date.  It
          can be one of ‘age’ (to show the age of the commit),
          ‘age-abbreviated’ (to abbreviate the time unit to a
          character), or a string (suitable for ‘format-time-string’) to
          show the actual date.  Option
          ‘magit-log-margin-show-committer-date’ controls which date is
          being displayed.
        • WIDTH controls the width of the margin.  This exists for
          forward compatibility and currently the value should not be
          changed.
        • AUTHOR controls whether the name of the author is also shown
          by default.
        • AUTHOR-WIDTH has to be an integer.  When the name of the
          author is shown, then this specifies how much space is used to
          do so.

   You can change the STYLE and AUTHOR-WIDTH of all ‘magit-INFIX-margin’
options to the same values by customizing ‘magit-log-margin’ *before*
‘magit’ is loaded.  If you do that, then the respective values for the
other options will default to what you have set for that variable.
Likewise if you set INIT in ‘magit-log-margin’ to ‘nil’, then that is
used in the default of all other options.  But setting it to ‘t’, i.e.
re-enforcing the default for that option, does not carry to other
options.

 -- User Option: magit-log-margin-show-committer-date
     This option specifies whether to show the committer date in the
     margin.  This option only controls whether the committer date is
     displayed instead of the author date.  Whether some date is
     displayed in the margin and whether the margin is displayed at all
     is controlled by other options.

‘L’ (‘magit-margin-settings’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands,
     each of which changes the appearance of the margin in some way.

   In some buffers that support the margin, ‘L’ is instead bound to
‘magit-log-refresh’, but that transient features the same commands, and
then some other unrelated commands.

‘L L’ (‘magit-toggle-margin’)
     This command shows or hides the margin.

‘L l’ (‘magit-cycle-margin-style’)
     This command cycles the style used for the margin.

‘L d’ (‘magit-toggle-margin-details’)
     This command shows or hides details in the margin.

5.3.4 Select from Log
---------------------

When the user has to select a recent commit that is reachable from
‘HEAD’, using regular completion would be inconvenient (because most
humans cannot remember hashes or "HEAD~5", at least not without double
checking).  Instead a log buffer is used to select the commit, which has
the advantage that commits are presented in order and with the commit
message.

   Such selection logs are used when selecting the beginning of a rebase
and when selecting the commit to be squashed into.

   In addition to the key bindings available in all log buffers, the
following additional key bindings are available in selection log
buffers:

‘C-c C-c’ (‘magit-log-select-pick’)
     Select the commit at point and act on it.  Call
     ‘magit-log-select-pick-function’ with the selected commit as
     argument.

‘C-c C-k’ (‘magit-log-select-quit’)
     Abort selecting a commit, don’t act on any commit.

 -- User Option: magit-log-select-margin
     This option specifies whether the margin is initially shown in
     Magit-Log-Select mode buffers and how it is formatted.

     The value has the form ‘(INIT STYLE WIDTH AUTHOR AUTHOR-WIDTH)’.

        • If INIT is non-nil, then the margin is shown initially.
        • STYLE controls how to format the author or committer date.  It
          can be one of ‘age’ (to show the age of the commit),
          ‘age-abbreviated’ (to abbreviate the time unit to a
          character), or a string (suitable for ‘format-time-string’) to
          show the actual date.  Option
          ‘magit-log-margin-show-committer-date’ controls which date is
          being displayed.
        • WIDTH controls the width of the margin.  This exists for
          forward compatibility and currently the value should not be
          changed.
        • AUTHOR controls whether the name of the author is also shown
          by default.
        • AUTHOR-WIDTH has to be an integer.  When the name of the
          author is shown, then this specifies how much space is used to
          do so.

5.3.5 Reflog
------------

Also see *note (gitman)git-reflog::.

   These reflog commands are available from the log transient.  See
*note Logging::.

‘l r’ (‘magit-reflog-current’)
     Display the reflog of the current branch.

‘l O’ (‘magit-reflog-other’)
     Display the reflog of a branch or another ref.

‘l H’ (‘magit-reflog-head’)
     Display the ‘HEAD’ reflog.

 -- User Option: magit-reflog-margin
     This option specifies whether the margin is initially shown in
     Magit-Reflog mode buffers and how it is formatted.

     The value has the form ‘(INIT STYLE WIDTH AUTHOR AUTHOR-WIDTH)’.

        • If INIT is non-nil, then the margin is shown initially.
        • STYLE controls how to format the author or committer date.  It
          can be one of ‘age’ (to show the age of the commit),
          ‘age-abbreviated’ (to abbreviate the time unit to a
          character), or a string (suitable for ‘format-time-string’) to
          show the actual date.  Option
          ‘magit-log-margin-show-committer-date’ controls which date is
          being displayed.
        • WIDTH controls the width of the margin.  This exists for
          forward compatibility and currently the value should not be
          changed.
        • AUTHOR controls whether the name of the author is also shown
          by default.
        • AUTHOR-WIDTH has to be an integer.  When the name of the
          author is shown, then this specifies how much space is used to
          do so.


File: magit.info,  Node: Cherries,  Prev: Reflog,  Up: Logging

5.3.6 Cherries
--------------

Cherries are commits that haven’t been applied upstream (yet), and are
usually visualized using a log.  Each commit is prefixed with ‘-’ if it
has an equivalent in the upstream and ‘+’ if it does not, i.e., if it is
a cherry.

   The command ‘magit-cherry’ shows cherries for a single branch, but
the references buffer (see *note References Buffer::) can show cherries
for multiple "upstreams" at once.

   Also see *note (gitman)git-reflog::.

‘Y’ (‘magit-cherry’)
     Show commits that are in a certain branch but that have not been
     merged in the upstream branch.

 -- User Option: magit-cherry-margin
     This option specifies whether the margin is initially shown in
     Magit-Cherry mode buffers and how it is formatted.

     The value has the form ‘(INIT STYLE WIDTH AUTHOR AUTHOR-WIDTH)’.

        • If INIT is non-nil, then the margin is shown initially.
        • STYLE controls how to format the author or committer date.  It
          can be one of ‘age’ (to show the age of the commit),
          ‘age-abbreviated’ (to abbreviate the time unit to a
          character), or a string (suitable for ‘format-time-string’) to
          show the actual date.  Option
          ‘magit-log-margin-show-committer-date’ controls which date is
          being displayed.
        • WIDTH controls the width of the margin.  This exists for
          forward compatibility and currently the value should not be
          changed.
        • AUTHOR controls whether the name of the author is also shown
          by default.
        • AUTHOR-WIDTH has to be an integer.  When the name of the
          author is shown, then this specifies how much space is used to

File: magit.info,  Node: Diffing,  Next: Ediffing,  Prev: Logging,  Up: Inspecting

5.4 Diffing
===========

The status buffer contains diffs for the staged and unstaged commits,
but that obviously isn’t enough.  The transient prefix command
‘magit-diff’, on ‘d’, features several suffix commands, which show a
specific diff in a separate diff buffer.

   Like other transient prefix commands, ‘magit-diff’ also features
several infix arguments that can be changed before invoking one of the
suffix commands.  However, in the case of the diff transient, these
arguments may be taken from those currently in use in the current
repository’s diff buffer, depending on the value of
‘magit-prefix-use-buffer-arguments’ (see *note Transient Arguments and
Buffer Variables::).

   Also see *note (gitman)git-diff::.

‘d’ (‘magit-diff’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

‘d d’ (‘magit-diff-dwim’)
     Show changes for the thing at point.

‘d r’ (‘magit-diff-range’)
     Show differences between two commits.

     RANGE should be a range (A..B or A...B) but can also be a single
     commit.  If one side of the range is omitted, then it defaults to
     ‘HEAD’.  If just a commit is given, then changes in the working
     tree relative to that commit are shown.

     If the region is active, use the revisions on the first and last
     line of the region.  With a prefix argument, instead of diffing the
     revisions, choose a revision to view changes along, starting at the
     common ancestor of both revisions (i.e., use a "..." range).

‘d w’ (‘magit-diff-working-tree’)
     Show changes between the current working tree and the ‘HEAD’
     commit.  With a prefix argument show changes between the working
     tree and a commit read from the minibuffer.

‘d s’ (‘magit-diff-staged’)
     Show changes between the index and the ‘HEAD’ commit.  With a
     prefix argument show changes between the index and a commit read
     from the minibuffer.

‘d u’ (‘magit-diff-unstaged’)
     Show changes between the working tree and the index.

‘d p’ (‘magit-diff-paths’)
     Show changes between any two files on disk.

   All of the above suffix commands update the repository’s diff buffer.
The diff transient also features two commands which show differences in
another buffer:

‘d c’ (‘magit-show-commit’)
     Show the commit at point.  If there is no commit at point or with a
     prefix argument, prompt for a commit.

‘d t’ (‘magit-stash-show’)
     Show all diffs of a stash in a buffer.

   Two additional commands that show the diff for the file or blob that
is being visited in the current buffer exists, see *note Commands for
Buffers Visiting Files::.

File: magit.info,  Node: Refreshing Diffs,  Next: Commands Available in Diffs,  Up: Diffing

5.4.1 Refreshing Diffs
----------------------

The transient prefix command ‘magit-diff-refresh’, on ‘D’, can be used
to change the diff arguments used in the current buffer, without
changing which diff is shown.  This works in dedicated diff buffers, but
also in the status buffer.

   (There is one exception; diff arguments cannot be changed in buffers
created by ‘magit-merge-preview’ because the underlying Git command does
not support these arguments.)

‘D’ (‘magit-diff-refresh’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

‘D g’ (‘magit-diff-refresh’)
     This suffix command sets the local diff arguments for the current
     buffer.

‘D s’ (‘magit-diff-set-default-arguments’)
     This suffix command sets the default diff arguments for buffers of
     the same type as that of the current buffer.  Other existing
     buffers of the same type are not affected because their local
     values have already been initialized.

‘D w’ (‘magit-diff-save-default-arguments’)
     This suffix command sets the default diff arguments for buffers of
     the same type as that of the current buffer, and saves the value
     for future sessions.  Other existing buffers of the same type are
     not affected because their local values have already been
     initialized.

‘D t’ (‘magit-diff-toggle-refine-hunk’)
     This command toggles hunk refinement on or off.

‘D r’ (‘magit-diff-switch-range-type’)
     This command converts the diff range type from "revA..revB" to
     "revB...revA", or vice versa.

‘D f’ (‘magit-diff-flip-revs’)
     This command swaps revisions in the diff range from "revA..revB" to
     "revB..revA", or vice versa.

‘D F’ (‘magit-diff-toggle-file-filter’)
     This command toggles the file restriction of the diffs in the
     current buffer, allowing you to quickly switch between viewing all
     the changes in the commit and the restricted subset.  As a special
     case, when this command is called from a log buffer, it toggles the
     file restriction in the repository’s revision buffer, which is
     useful when you display a revision from a log buffer that is
     restricted to a file or files.

   In addition to the above transient, which allows changing any of the
supported arguments, there also exist some commands that change only a
particular argument.

‘-’ (‘magit-diff-less-context’)
     This command decreases the context for diff hunks by COUNT lines.

‘+’ (‘magit-diff-more-context’)
     This command increases the context for diff hunks by COUNT lines.

‘0’ (‘magit-diff-default-context’)
     This command resets the context for diff hunks to the default
     height.

   The following commands quickly change what diff is being displayed
without having to using one of the diff transient.

‘C-c C-d’ (‘magit-diff-while-committing’)
     While committing, this command shows the changes that are about to
     be committed.  While amending, invoking the command again toggles
     between showing just the new changes or all the changes that will
     be committed.

     This binding is available in the diff buffer as well as the commit
     message buffer.

‘C-c C-b’ (‘magit-go-backward’)
     This command moves backward in current buffer’s history.

‘C-c C-f’ (‘magit-go-forward’)
     This command moves forward in current buffer’s history.

5.4.2 Commands Available in Diffs
---------------------------------

Some commands are only available if point is inside a diff.

   ‘magit-diff-visit-file’ and related commands visit the appropriate
version of the file that the diff at point is about.  Likewise
‘magit-diff-visit-worktree-file’ and related commands visit the worktree
version of the file that the diff at point is about.  See *note Visiting
Files and Blobs from a Diff:: for more information and the key bindings.

‘C-c C-t’ (‘magit-diff-trace-definition’)
     This command shows a log for the definition at point.

 -- User Option: magit-log-trace-definition-function
     The function specified by this option is used by
     ‘magit-log-trace-definition’ to determine the function at point.
     For major-modes that have special needs, you could set the local
     value using the mode’s hook.

‘C-c C-e’ (‘magit-diff-edit-hunk-commit’)
     From a hunk, this command edits the respective commit and visits
     the file.

     First it visits the file being modified by the hunk at the correct
     location using ‘magit-diff-visit-file’.  This actually visits a
     blob.  When point is on a diff header, not within an individual
     hunk, then this visits the blob the first hunk is about.

     Then it invokes ‘magit-edit-line-commit’, which uses an interactive
     rebase to make the commit editable, or if that is not possible
     because the commit is not reachable from ‘HEAD’ by checking out
     that commit directly.  This also causes the actual worktree file to
     be visited.

     Neither the blob nor the file buffer are killed when finishing the
     rebase.  If that is undesirable, then it might be better to use
     ‘magit-rebase-edit-commit’ instead of this command.

‘j’ (‘magit-jump-to-diffstat-or-diff’)
     This command jumps to the diffstat or diff.  When point is on a
     file inside the diffstat section, then jump to the respective diff
     section.  Otherwise, jump to the diffstat section or a child
     thereof.

   The next two commands are not specific to Magit-Diff mode (or and
Magit buffer for that matter), but it might be worth pointing out that
they are available here too.

‘<SPC>’ (‘scroll-up’)
     This command scrolls text upward.

‘<DEL>’ (‘scroll-down’)
     This command scrolls text downward.

5.4.3 Diff Options
------------------

 -- User Option: magit-diff-refine-hunk
     Whether to show word-granularity differences within diff hunks.

        • ‘nil’ Never show fine differences.
        • ‘t’ Show fine differences for the current diff hunk only.
        • ‘all’ Show fine differences for all displayed diff hunks.

 -- User Option: magit-diff-refine-ignore-whitespace
     Whether to ignore whitespace changes in word-granularity
     differences.

 -- User Option: magit-diff-adjust-tab-width
     Whether to adjust the width of tabs in diffs.

     Determining the correct width can be expensive if it requires
     opening large and/or many files, so the widths are cached in the
     variable ‘magit-diff--tab-width-cache’.  Set that to nil to
     invalidate the cache.

        • ‘nil’ Never adjust tab width.  Use ‘tab-width’s value from the
          Magit buffer itself instead.

        • ‘t’ If the corresponding file-visiting buffer exits, then use
          ‘tab-width’’s value from that buffer.  Doing this is cheap, so
          this value is used even if a corresponding cache entry exists.

        • ‘always’ If there is no such buffer, then temporarily visit
          the file to determine the value.

        • NUMBER Like ‘always’, but don’t visit files larger than NUMBER
          bytes.

 -- User Option: magit-diff-paint-whitespace
     Specify where to highlight whitespace errors.

     See ‘magit-diff-highlight-trailing’,
     ‘magit-diff-highlight-indentation’.  The symbol ‘t’ means in all
     diffs, ‘status’ means only in the status buffer, and nil means
     nowhere.

        • ‘nil’ Never highlight whitespace errors.
        • ‘t’ Highlight whitespace errors everywhere.
        • ‘uncommitted’ Only highlight whitespace errors in diffs
          showing uncommitted changes.  For backward compatibility
          ‘status’ is treated as a synonym.

 -- User Option: magit-diff-paint-whitespace-lines
     Specify in what kind of lines to highlight whitespace errors.

        • ‘t’ Highlight only in added lines.
        • ‘both’ Highlight in added and removed lines.
        • ‘all’ Highlight in added, removed and context lines.

 -- User Option: magit-diff-highlight-trailing
     Whether to highlight whitespace at the end of a line in diffs.
     Used only when ‘magit-diff-paint-whitespace’ is non-nil.

 -- User Option: magit-diff-highlight-indentation
     This option controls whether to highlight the indentation in case
     it used the "wrong" indentation style.  Indentation is only
     highlighted if ‘magit-diff-paint-whitespace’ is also non-nil.

     The value is an alist of the form ‘((REGEXP . INDENT)...)’.  The
     path to the current repository is matched against each element in
     reverse order.  Therefore if a REGEXP matches, then earlier
     elements are not tried.

     If the used INDENT is ‘tabs’, highlight indentation with tabs.  If
     INDENT is an integer, highlight indentation with at least that many
     spaces.  Otherwise, highlight neither.

 -- User Option: magit-diff-hide-trailing-cr-characters
     Whether to hide ^M characters at the end of a line in diffs.

 -- User Option: magit-diff-highlight-hunk-region-functions
     This option specifies the functions used to highlight the
     hunk-internal region.

     ‘magit-diff-highlight-hunk-region-dim-outside’ overlays the outside
     of the hunk internal selection with a face that causes the added
     and removed lines to have the same background color as context
     lines.  This function should not be removed from the value of this
     option.

     ‘magit-diff-highlight-hunk-region-using-overlays’ and
     ‘magit-diff-highlight-hunk-region-using-underline’ emphasize the
     region by placing delimiting horizontal lines before and after it.
     Both of these functions have glitches which cannot be fixed due to
     limitations of Emacs’ display engine.  For more information see
     <https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/2758> ff.

     Instead of, or in addition to, using delimiting horizontal lines,
     to emphasize the boundaries, you may wish to emphasize the text
     itself, using ‘magit-diff-highlight-hunk-region-using-face’.

     In terminal frames it’s not possible to draw lines as the overlay
     and underline variants normally do, so there they fall back to
     calling the face function instead.

 -- User Option: magit-diff-unmarked-lines-keep-foreground
     This option controls whether added and removed lines outside the
     hunk-internal region only lose their distinct background color or
     also the foreground color.  Whether the outside of the region is
     dimmed at all depends on
     ‘magit-diff-highlight-hunk-region-functions’.

 -- User Option: magit-diff-extra-stat-arguments
     This option specifies additional arguments to be used alongside
     ‘--stat’.

     The value is a list of zero or more arguments or a function that
     takes no argument and returns such a list.  These arguments are
     allowed here: ‘--stat-width’, ‘--stat-name-width’,
     ‘--stat-graph-width’ and ‘--compact-summary’.  Also see *note
     (gitman)git-diff::.


File: magit.info,  Node: Revision Buffer,  Prev: Diff Options,  Up: Diffing

5.4.4 Revision Buffer
---------------------

 -- User Option: magit-revision-insert-related-refs
     Whether to show related branches in revision buffers.

        • ‘nil’ Don’t show any related branches.
        • ‘t’ Show related local branches.
        • ‘all’ Show related local and remote branches.
        • ‘mixed’ Show all containing branches and local merged
          branches.

 -- User Option: magit-revision-show-gravatars
     Whether to show gravatar images in revision buffers.

     If ‘nil’, then don’t insert any gravatar images.  If ‘t’, then
     insert both images.  If ‘author’ or ‘committer’, then insert only
     the respective image.

     If you have customized the option ‘magit-revision-headers-format’
     and want to insert the images then you might also have to specify
     where to do so.  In that case the value has to be a cons-cell of
     two regular expressions.  The car specifies where to insert the
     author’s image.  The top half of the image is inserted right after
     the matched text, the bottom half on the next line in the same
     column.  The cdr specifies where to insert the committer’s image,
     accordingly.  Either the car or the cdr may be nil."

 -- User Option: magit-revision-use-hash-sections
     Whether to turn hashes inside the commit message into sections.

     If non-nil, then hashes inside the commit message are turned into
     ‘commit’ sections.  There is a trade off to be made between
     performance and reliability:

        • ‘slow’ calls git for every word to be absolutely sure.
        • ‘quick’ skips words less than seven characters long.
        • ‘quicker’ additionally skips words that don’t contain a
          number.
        • ‘quickest’ uses all words that are at least seven characters
          long and which contain at least one number as well as at least
          one letter.

     If nil, then no hashes are turned into sections, but you can still
     visit the commit at point using "RET".

   The diffs shown in the revision buffer may be automatically
restricted to a subset of the changed files.  If the revision buffer is
displayed from a log buffer, the revision buffer will share the same
file restriction as that log buffer (also see the command
‘magit-diff-toggle-file-filter’).

 -- User Option: magit-revision-filter-files-on-follow
     Whether showing a commit from a log buffer honors the log’s file
     filter when the log arguments include ‘--follow’.

     When this option is nil, displaying a commit from a log ignores the
     log’s file filter if the log arguments include ‘--follow’.  Doing
     so avoids showing an empty diff in revision buffers for commits
     before a rename event.  In such cases, the ‘--patch’ argument of
     the log transient can be used to show the file-restricted diffs
     inline.

     Set this option to non-nil to keep the log’s file restriction even
     if ‘--follow’ is present in the log arguments.

   If the revision buffer is not displayed from a log buffer, the file
restriction is determined as usual (see *note Transient Arguments and
Buffer Variables::).

5.5 Ediffing
============

This section describes how to enter Ediff from Magit buffers.  For
information on how to use Ediff itself, see *note (ediff)Top::.

‘e’ (‘magit-ediff-dwim’)
     Compare, stage, or resolve using Ediff.

     This command tries to guess what file, and what commit or range the
     user wants to compare, stage, or resolve using Ediff.  It might
     only be able to guess either the file, or range/commit, in which
     case the user is asked about the other.  It might not always guess
     right, in which case the appropriate ‘magit-ediff-*’ command has to
     be used explicitly.  If it cannot read the user’s mind at all, then
     it asks the user for a command to run.

‘E’ (‘magit-ediff’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     and displays them in a temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

‘E r’ (‘magit-ediff-compare’)
     Compare two revisions of a file using Ediff.

     If the region is active, use the revisions on the first and last
     line of the region.  With a prefix argument, instead of diffing the
     revisions, choose a revision to view changes along, starting at the
     common ancestor of both revisions (i.e., use a "..." range).

‘E m’ (‘magit-ediff-resolve-rest’)
     This command allows you to resolve outstanding conflicts in the
     file at point using Ediff.  If there is no file at point or if it
     doesn’t have any unmerged changes, then this command prompts for a
     file.

     Provided that the value of ‘merge.conflictstyle’ is ‘diff3’, you
     can view the file’s merge-base revision using ‘/’ in the Ediff
     control buffer.

     The A, B and Ancestor buffers are constructed from the conflict
     markers in the worktree file.  Because you and/or Git may have
     already resolved some conflicts, that means that these buffers may
     not contain the actual versions from the respective blobs.

‘E m’ (‘magit-ediff-resolve-all’)
     This command allows you to resolve all conflicts in the file at
     point using Ediff.  If there is no file at point or if it doesn’t
     have any unmerged changes, then this command prompts for a file.

     Provided that the value of ‘merge.conflictstyle’ is ‘diff3’, you
     can view the file’s merge-base revision using ‘/’ in the Ediff
     control buffer.

     First the file in the worktree is moved aside, appending the suffix
     ‘.ORIG’, so that you could later go back to that version.  Then it
     is reconstructed from the two sides of the conflict and the
     merge-base, if available.

     It would be nice if the worktree file were just used as-is, but
     Ediff does not support that.  This means that all conflicts, that
     Git has already resolved, are restored.  On the other hand Ediff
     also tries to resolve conflicts, and in many cases Ediff and Git
     should produce similar results.

     However if you have already resolved some conflicts manually, then
     those changes are discarded (though you can recover them from the
     backup file).  In such cases ‘magit-ediff-resolve-rest’ might be
     more suitable.

     The advantage that this command has over ‘magit-ediff-resolve-rest’
     is that the A, B and Ancestor buffers correspond to blobs from the
     respective commits, allowing you to inspect a side in context and
     to use Magit commands in these buffers to do so.  Blame and log
     commands are particularly useful here.

‘E t’ (‘magit-git-mergetool’)
     This command does not actually use Ediff.  While it serves the same
     purpose as ‘magit-ediff-resolve-rest’, it uses ‘git mergetool
     --gui’ to resolve conflicts.

     With a prefix argument this acts as a transient prefix command,
     allowing the user to select the mergetool and change some settings.

‘E s’ (‘magit-ediff-stage’)
     Stage and unstage changes to a file using Ediff, defaulting to the
     file at point.

‘E u’ (‘magit-ediff-show-unstaged’)
     Show unstaged changes to a file using Ediff.

‘E i’ (‘magit-ediff-show-staged’)
     Show staged changes to a file using Ediff.

‘E w’ (‘magit-ediff-show-working-tree’)
     Show changes in a file between ‘HEAD’ and working tree using Ediff.

‘E c’ (‘magit-ediff-show-commit’)
     Show changes to a file introduced by a commit using Ediff.

‘E z’ (‘magit-ediff-show-stash’)
     Show changes to a file introduced by a stash using Ediff.

 -- User Option: magit-ediff-dwim-resolve-function
     This option controls which function ‘magit-ediff-dwim’ uses to
     resolve conflicts.  One of ‘magit-ediff-resolve-rest’,
     ‘magit-ediff-resolve-all’ or ‘magit-git-mergetool’; which are all
     discussed above.

 -- User Option: magit-ediff-dwim-show-on-hunks
     This option controls what command ‘magit-ediff-dwim’ calls when
     point is on uncommitted hunks.  When nil, always run
     ‘magit-ediff-stage’.  Otherwise, use ‘magit-ediff-show-staged’ and
     ‘magit-ediff-show-unstaged’ to show staged and unstaged changes,
     respectively.

 -- User Option: magit-ediff-show-stash-with-index
     This option controls whether ‘magit-ediff-show-stash’ includes a
     buffer containing the file’s state in the index at the time the
     stash was created.  This makes it possible to tell which changes in
     the stash were staged.

 -- User Option: magit-ediff-quit-hook
     This hook is run after quitting an Ediff session that was created
     using a Magit command.  The hook functions are run inside the Ediff
     control buffer, and should not change the current buffer.

     This is similar to ‘ediff-quit-hook’ but takes the needs of Magit
     into account.  The regular ‘ediff-quit-hook’ is ignored by Ediff
     sessions that were created using a Magit command.

5.6 References Buffer
=====================

‘y’ (‘magit-show-refs’)
     This command lists branches and tags in a dedicated buffer.

     However if this command is invoked again from this buffer or if it
     is invoked with a prefix argument, then it acts as a transient
     prefix command, which binds the following suffix commands and some
     infix arguments.

   All of the following suffix commands list exactly the same branches
and tags.  The only difference the optional feature that can be enabled
by changing the value of ‘magit-refs-show-commit-count’ (see below).
These commands specify a different branch or commit against which all
the other references are compared.

‘y y’ (‘magit-show-refs-head’)
     This command lists branches and tags in a dedicated buffer.  Each
     reference is being compared with ‘HEAD’.

‘y c’ (‘magit-show-refs-current’)
     This command lists branches and tags in a dedicated buffer.  Each
     reference is being compared with the current branch or ‘HEAD’ if it
     is detached.

‘y o’ (‘magit-show-refs-other’)
     This command lists branches and tags in a dedicated buffer.  Each
     reference is being compared with a branch read from the user.

‘y r’ (‘magit-refs-set-show-commit-count’)
     This command changes for which refs the commit count is shown.

 -- User Option: magit-refs-show-commit-count
     Whether to show commit counts in Magit-Refs mode buffers.

        • ‘all’ Show counts for branches and tags.
        • ‘branch’ Show counts for branches only.
        • ‘nil’ Never show counts.

     The default is ‘nil’ because anything else can be very expensive.

 -- User Option: magit-refs-pad-commit-counts
     Whether to pad all commit counts on all sides in Magit-Refs mode
     buffers.

     If this is nil, then some commit counts are displayed right next to
     one of the branches that appear next to the count, without any
     space in between.  This might look bad if the branch name faces
     look too similar to ‘magit-dimmed’.

     If this is non-nil, then spaces are placed on both sides of all
     commit counts.

 -- User Option: magit-refs-show-remote-prefix
     Whether to show the remote prefix in lists of remote branches.

     Showing the prefix is redundant because the name of the remote is
     already shown in the heading preceding the list of its branches.

 -- User Option: magit-refs-primary-column-width
     Width of the primary column in ‘magit-refs-mode’ buffers.  The
     primary column is the column that contains the name of the branch
     that the current row is about.

     If this is an integer, then the column is that many columns wide.
     Otherwise it has to be a cons-cell of two integers.  The first
     specifies the minimal width, the second the maximal width.  In that
     case the actual width is determined using the length of the names
     of the shown local branches.  (Remote branches and tags are not
     taken into account when calculating to optimal width.)

 -- User Option: magit-refs-focus-column-width
     Width of the focus column in ‘magit-refs-mode’ buffers.

     The focus column is the first column, which marks one branch
     (usually the current branch) as the focused branch using ‘*’ or
     ‘@’.  For each other reference, this column optionally shows how
     many commits it is ahead of the focused branch and ‘<’, or if it
     isn’t ahead then the commits it is behind and ‘>’, or if it isn’t
     behind either, then a ‘=’.

     This column may also display only ‘*’ or ‘@’ for the focused
     branch, in which case this option is ignored.  Use ‘L v’ to change
     the verbosity of this column.

 -- User Option: magit-refs-margin
     This option specifies whether the margin is initially shown in
     Magit-Refs mode buffers and how it is formatted.

     The value has the form ‘(INIT STYLE WIDTH AUTHOR AUTHOR-WIDTH)’.

        • If INIT is non-nil, then the margin is shown initially.
        • STYLE controls how to format the author or committer date.  It
          can be one of ‘age’ (to show the age of the commit),
          ‘age-abbreviated’ (to abbreviate the time unit to a
          character), or a string (suitable for ‘format-time-string’) to
          show the actual date.  Option
          ‘magit-log-margin-show-committer-date’ controls which date is
          being displayed.
        • WIDTH controls the width of the margin.  This exists for
          forward compatibility and currently the value should not be
          changed.
        • AUTHOR controls whether the name of the author is also shown
          by default.
        • AUTHOR-WIDTH has to be an integer.  When the name of the
          author is shown, then this specifies how much space is used to
          do so.

 -- User Option: magit-refs-margin-for-tags
     This option specifies whether to show information about tags in the
     margin.  This is disabled by default because it is slow if there
     are many tags.

   The following variables control how individual refs are displayed.
If you change one of these variables (especially the "%c" part), then
you should also change the others to keep things aligned.  The following
%-sequences are supported:

   • ‘%a’ Number of commits this ref has over the one we compare to.
   • ‘%b’ Number of commits the ref we compare to has over this one.
   • ‘%c’ Number of commits this ref has over the one we compare to.
     For the ref which all other refs are compared this is instead "@",
     if it is the current branch, or "#" otherwise.
   • ‘%C’ For the ref which all other refs are compared this is "@", if
     it is the current branch, or "#" otherwise.  For all other refs "
     ".
   • ‘%h’ Hash of this ref’s tip.
   • ‘%m’ Commit summary of the tip of this ref.
   • ‘%n’ Name of this ref.
   • ‘%u’ Upstream of this local branch.
   • ‘%U’ Upstream of this local branch and additional local vs.
     upstream information.

 -- User Option: magit-refs-filter-alist
     The purpose of this option is to forgo displaying certain refs
     based on their name.  If you want to not display any refs of a
     certain type, then you should remove the appropriate function from
     ‘magit-refs-sections-hook’ instead.

     This alist controls which tags and branches are omitted from being
     displayed in ‘magit-refs-mode’ buffers.  If it is ‘nil’, then all
     refs are displayed (subject to ‘magit-refs-sections-hook’).

     All keys are tried in order until one matches.  Then its value is
     used and subsequent elements are ignored.  If the value is non-nil,
     then the reference is displayed, otherwise it is not.  If no
     element matches, then the reference is displayed.

     A key can either be a regular expression that the refname has to
     match, or a function that takes the refname as only argument and
     returns a boolean.  A remote branch such as "origin/master" is
     displayed as just "master", however for this comparison the former
     is used.

‘<RET>’ (‘magit-visit-ref’)
     This command visits the reference or revision at point in another
     buffer.  If there is no revision at point or with a prefix argument
     then it prompts for a revision.

     This command behaves just like ‘magit-show-commit’ as described
     above, except if point is on a reference in a ‘magit-refs-mode’
     buffer, in which case the behavior may be different, but only if
     you have customized the option ‘magit-visit-ref-behavior’.

 -- User Option: magit-visit-ref-behavior
     This option controls how ‘magit-visit-ref’ behaves in
     ‘magit-refs-mode’ buffers.

     By default ‘magit-visit-ref’ behaves like ‘magit-show-commit’, in
     all buffers, including ‘magit-refs-mode’ buffers.  When the type of
     the section at point is ‘commit’ then "RET" is bound to
     ‘magit-show-commit’, and when the type is either ‘branch’ or ‘tag’
     then it is bound to ‘magit-visit-ref’.

     "RET" is one of Magit’s most essential keys and at least by default
     it should behave consistently across all of Magit, especially
     because users quickly learn that it does something very harmless;
     it shows more information about the thing at point in another
     buffer.

     However "RET" used to behave differently in ‘magit-refs-mode’
     buffers, doing surprising things, some of which cannot really be
     described as "visit this thing".  If you’ve grown accustomed this
     behavior, you can restore it by adding one or more of the below
     symbols to the value of this option.  But keep in mind that by
     doing so you don’t only introduce inconsistencies, you also lose
     some functionality and might have to resort to ‘M-x
     magit-show-commit’ to get it back.

     ‘magit-visit-ref’ looks for these symbols in the order in which
     they are described here.  If the presence of a symbol applies to
     the current situation, then the symbols that follow do not affect
     the outcome.

        • ‘focus-on-ref’

          With a prefix argument update the buffer to show commit counts
          and lists of cherry commits relative to the reference at point
          instead of relative to the current buffer or ‘HEAD’.

          Instead of adding this symbol, consider pressing "C-u y o
          RET".

        • ‘create-branch’

          If point is on a remote branch, then create a new local branch
          with the same name, use the remote branch as its upstream, and
          then check out the local branch.

          Instead of adding this symbol, consider pressing "b c RET
          RET", like you would do in other buffers.

        • ‘checkout-any’

          Check out the reference at point.  If that reference is a tag
          or a remote branch, then this results in a detached ‘HEAD’.

          Instead of adding this symbol, consider pressing "b b RET",
          like you would do in other buffers.

        • ‘checkout-branch’

          Check out the local branch at point.

          Instead of adding this symbol, consider pressing "b b RET",
          like you would do in other buffers.

5.7 Bisecting
=============

Also see *note (gitman)git-bisect::.

‘B’ (‘magit-bisect’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     and displays them in a temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

   When bisecting is not in progress, then the transient features the
following suffix commands.

‘B B’ (‘magit-bisect-start’)
     Start a bisect session.

     Bisecting a bug means to find the commit that introduced it.  This
     command starts such a bisect session by asking for a known good
     commit and a known bad commit.  If you’re bisecting a change that
     isn’t a regression, you can select alternate terms that are
     conceptually more fitting than "bad" and "good", but the infix
     arguments to do so are disabled by default.

‘B s’ (‘magit-bisect-run’)
     Bisect automatically by running commands after each step.

   When bisecting in progress, then the transient instead features the
following suffix commands.

‘B b’ (‘magit-bisect-bad’)
     Mark the current commit as bad.  Use this after you have asserted
     that the commit does contain the bug in question.

‘B g’ (‘magit-bisect-good’)
     Mark the current commit as good.  Use this after you have asserted
     that the commit does not contain the bug in question.

‘B m’ (‘magit-bisect-mark’)
     Mark the current commit with one of the bisect terms.  This command
     provides an alternative to ‘magit-bisect-bad’ and
     ‘magit-bisect-good’ and is useful when using terms other than "bad"
     and "good".  This suffix is disabled by default.

‘B k’ (‘magit-bisect-skip’)
     Skip the current commit.  Use this if for some reason the current
     commit is not a good one to test.  This command lets Git choose a
     different one.

‘B r’ (‘magit-bisect-reset’)
     After bisecting, cleanup bisection state and return to original
     ‘HEAD’.

   By default the status buffer shows information about the ongoing
bisect session.

 -- User Option: magit-bisect-show-graph
     This option controls whether a graph is displayed for the log of
     commits that still have to be bisected.

5.8 Visiting Files and Blobs
============================

Magit provides several commands that visit a file or blob (the version
of a file that is stored in a certain commit).  Actually it provides
several *groups* of such commands and the several *variants* within each
group.

   Also see *note Commands for Buffers Visiting Files::.

5.8.1 General-Purpose Visit Commands
------------------------------------

These commands can be used anywhere to open any blob.  Currently no keys
are bound to these commands by default, but that is likely to change.

 -- Command: magit-find-file
     This command reads a filename and revision from the user and visits
     the respective blob in a buffer.  The buffer is displayed in the
     selected window.

 -- Command: magit-find-file-other-window
     This command reads a filename and revision from the user and visits
     the respective blob in a buffer.  The buffer is displayed in
     another window.

 -- Command: magit-find-file-other-frame
     This command reads a filename and revision from the user and visits
     the respective blob in a buffer.  The buffer is displayed in
     another frame.


File: magit.info,  Node: Visiting Files and Blobs from a Diff,  Prev: General-Purpose Visit Commands,  Up: Visiting Files and Blobs

5.8.2 Visiting Files and Blobs from a Diff
------------------------------------------

These commands can only be used when point is inside a diff.

‘<RET>’ (‘magit-diff-visit-file’)
     This command visits the appropriate version of the file that the
     diff at point is about.

     This commands visits the worktree version of the appropriate file.
     The location of point inside the diff determines which file is
     being visited.  The visited version depends on what changes the
     diff is about.

       1. If the diff shows uncommitted changes (i.e., staged or
          unstaged changes), then visit the file in the working tree
          (i.e., the same "real" file that ‘find-file’ would visit.  In
          all other cases visit a "blob" (i.e., the version of a file as
          stored in some commit).

       2. If point is on a removed line, then visit the blob for the
          first parent of the commit that removed that line, i.e., the
          last commit where that line still exists.

       3. If point is on an added or context line, then visit the blob
          that adds that line, or if the diff shows from more than a
          single commit, then visit the blob from the last of these
          commits.

     In the file-visiting buffer this command goes to the line that
     corresponds to the line that point is on in the diff.

     The buffer is displayed in the selected window.  With a prefix
     argument the buffer is displayed in another window instead.

 -- User Option: magit-diff-visit-previous-blob
     This option controls whether ‘magit-diff-visit-file’ may visit the
     previous blob.  When this is ‘t’ (the default) and point is on a
     removed line in a diff for a committed change, then
     ‘magit-diff-visit-file’ visits the blob from the last revision
     which still had that line.

     Currently this is only supported for committed changes, for staged
     and unstaged changes ‘magit-diff-visit-file’ always visits the file
     in the working tree.

‘C-<return>’ (‘magit-diff-visit-file-worktree’)
     This command visits the worktree version of the appropriate file.
     The location of point inside the diff determines which file is
     being visited.  Unlike ‘magit-diff-visit-file’ it always visits the
     "real" file in the working tree, i.e the "current version" of the
     file.

     In the file-visiting buffer this command goes to the line that
     corresponds to the line that point is on in the diff.  Lines that
     were added or removed in the working tree, the index and other
     commits in between are automatically accounted for.

     The buffer is displayed in the selected window.  With a prefix
     argument the buffer is displayed in another window instead.

   Variants of the above two commands exist that instead visit the file
in another window or in another frame.  If you prefer such behavior,
then you may want to change the above key bindings, but note that the
above commands also use another window when invoked with a prefix
argument.

 -- Command: magit-diff-visit-file-other-window
 -- Command: magit-diff-visit-file-other-frame
 -- Command: magit-diff-visit-worktree-file-other-window
 -- Command: magit-diff-visit-worktree-file-other-frame

5.9 Blaming
===========

Also see *note (gitman)git-blame::.

   To start blaming, invoke the ‘magit-file-dispatch’ transient prefix
command.  When using the default key bindings, that can be done by
pressing ‘C-c M-g’.  When using the recommended bindings, this command
is instead bound to ‘C-c f’.  Also see *note Global Bindings::.

   The blaming suffix commands can be invoked directly from the file
dispatch transient.  However if you want to set an infix argument, then
you have to enter the blaming sub-prefix first.

‘C-c f B’ (‘magit-blame’)
‘C-c f b’ (‘magit-blame-addition’)
‘C-c f B b’
‘C-c f r’ (‘magit-blame-removal’)
‘C-c f B r’
‘C-c f f’ (‘magit-blame-reverse’)
‘C-c f B f’
‘C-c f e’ (‘magit-blame-echo’)
‘C-c f B e’
‘C-c f q’ (‘magit-blame-quit’)
‘C-c f B q’
     Each of these commands is documented individually right below,
     alongside their default key bindings.  The bindings shown above are
     the recommended bindings, which you can enable by following the
     instructions in *note Global Bindings::.

‘C-c M-g B’ (‘magit-blame’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

   Note that not all of the following suffixes are available at all
times.  For example if ‘magit-blame-mode’ is not enabled, then the
command whose purpose is to turn off that mode would not be of any use
and therefore isn’t available.

‘C-c M-g b’ (‘magit-blame-addition’)
‘C-c M-g B b’
     This command augments each line or chunk of lines in the current
     file-visiting or blob-visiting buffer with information about what
     commits last touched these lines.

     If the buffer visits a revision of that file, then history up to
     that revision is considered.  Otherwise, the file’s full history is
     considered, including uncommitted changes.

     If Magit-Blame mode is already turned on in the current buffer then
     blaming is done recursively, by visiting REVISION:FILE (using
     ‘magit-find-file’), where REVISION is a parent of the revision that
     added the current line or chunk of lines.

‘C-c M-g r’ (‘magit-blame-removal’)
‘C-c M-g B r’
     This command augments each line or chunk of lines in the current
     blob-visiting buffer with information about the revision that
     removes it.  It cannot be used in file-visiting buffers.

     Like ‘magit-blame-addition’, this command can be used recursively.

‘C-c M-g f’ (‘magit-blame-reverse’)
‘C-c M-g B f’
     This command augments each line or chunk of lines in the current
     file-visiting or blob-visiting buffer with information about the
     last revision in which a line still existed.

     Like ‘magit-blame-addition’, this command can be used recursively.

‘C-c M-g e’ (‘magit-blame-echo’)
‘C-c M-g B e’
     This command is like ‘magit-blame-addition’ except that it doesn’t
     turn on ‘read-only-mode’ and that it initially uses the
     visualization style specified by option ‘magit-blame-echo-style’.

   The following key bindings are available when Magit-Blame mode is
enabled and Read-Only mode is not enabled.  These commands are also
available in other buffers; here only the behavior is described that is
relevant in file-visiting buffers that are being blamed.

‘C-c M-g q’ (‘magit-blame-quit’)
‘C-c M-g B q’
     This command turns off Magit-Blame mode.  If the buffer was created
     during a recursive blame, then it also kills the buffer.

‘<RET>’ (‘magit-show-commit’)
     This command shows the commit that last touched the line at point.

‘<SPC>’ (‘magit-diff-show-or-scroll-up’)
     This command updates the commit buffer.

     This either shows the commit that last touched the line at point in
     the appropriate buffer, or if that buffer is already being
     displayed in the current frame and if that buffer contains
     information about that commit, then the buffer is scrolled up
     instead.

‘<DEL>’ (‘magit-diff-show-or-scroll-down’)
     This command updates the commit buffer.

     This either shows the commit that last touched the line at point in
     the appropriate buffer, or if that buffer is already being
     displayed in the current frame and if that buffer contains
     information about that commit, then the buffer is scrolled down
     instead.

   The following key bindings are available when both Magit-Blame mode
and Read-Only mode are enabled.

‘b’ (‘magit-blame’)
     See above.

‘n’ (‘magit-blame-next-chunk’)
     This command moves to the next chunk.

‘N’ (‘magit-blame-next-chunk-same-commit’)
     This command moves to the next chunk from the same commit.

‘p’ (‘magit-blame-previous-chunk’)
     This command moves to the previous chunk.

‘P’ (‘magit-blame-previous-chunk-same-commit’)
     This command moves to the previous chunk from the same commit.

‘q’ (‘magit-blame-quit’)
     This command turns off Magit-Blame mode.  If the buffer was created
     during a recursive blame, then it also kills the buffer.

‘M-w’ (‘magit-blame-copy-hash’)
     This command saves the hash of the current chunk’s commit to the
     kill ring.

     When the region is active, the command saves the region’s content
     instead of the hash, like ‘kill-ring-save’ would.

‘c’ (‘magit-blame-cycle-style’)
     This command changes how blame information is visualized in the
     current buffer by cycling through the styles specified using the
     option ‘magit-blame-styles’.

   Blaming is also controlled using the following options.

 -- User Option: magit-blame-styles
     This option defines a list of styles used to visualize blame
     information.  For now see its doc-string to learn more.

 -- User Option: magit-blame-echo-style
     This option specifies the blame visualization style used by the
     command ‘magit-blame-echo’.  This must be a symbol that is used as
     the identifier for one of the styles defined in
     ‘magit-blame-styles’.

 -- User Option: magit-blame-time-format
     This option specifies the format string used to display times when
     showing blame information.

 -- User Option: magit-blame-read-only
     This option controls whether blaming a buffer also makes
     temporarily read-only.

 -- User Option: magit-blame-disable-modes
     This option lists incompatible minor-modes that should be disabled
     temporarily when a buffer contains blame information.  They are
     enabled again when the buffer no longer shows blame information.

 -- User Option: magit-blame-goto-chunk-hook
     This hook is run when moving between chunks.

6.1 Creating Repository
=======================

‘I’ (‘magit-init’)
     This command initializes a repository and then shows the status
     buffer for the new repository.

     If the directory is below an existing repository, then the user has
     to confirm that a new one should be created inside.  If the
     directory is the root of the existing repository, then the user has
     to confirm that it should be reinitialized.


File: magit.info,  Node: Cloning Repository,  Next: Staging and Unstaging,  Prev: Creating Repository,  Up: Manipulating

6.2 Cloning Repository
======================

To clone a remote or local repository use ‘C’, which is bound to the
command ‘magit-clone’.  This command either act as a transient prefix
command, which binds several infix arguments and suffix commands, or it
can invoke ‘git clone’ directly, depending on whether a prefix argument
is used and on the value of ‘magit-clone-always-transient’.

 -- User Option: magit-clone-always-transient
     This option controls whether the command ‘magit-clone’ always acts
     as a transient prefix command, regardless of whether a prefix
     argument is used or not.  If ‘t’, then that command always acts as
     a transient prefix.  If ‘nil’, then a prefix argument has to be
     used for it to act as a transient.

‘C’ (‘magit-clone’)
     This command either acts as a transient prefix command as described
     above or does the same thing as ‘transient-clone-regular’ as
     described below.

     If it acts as a transient prefix, then it binds the following
     suffix commands and several infix arguments.

‘C C’ (‘magit-clone-regular’)
     This command creates a regular clone of an existing repository.
     The repository and the target directory are read from the user.

‘C s’ (‘magit-clone-shallow’)
     This command creates a shallow clone of an existing repository.
     The repository and the target directory are read from the user.  By
     default the depth of the cloned history is a single commit, but
     with a prefix argument the depth is read from the user.

‘C >’ (‘magit-clone-sparse’)
     This command creates a clone of an existing repository and
     initializes a sparse checkout, avoiding a checkout of the full
     working tree.  To add more directories, use the
     ‘magit-sparse-checkout’ transient (see *note Sparse checkouts::).

‘C b’ (‘magit-clone-bare’)
     This command creates a bare clone of an existing repository.  The
     repository and the target directory are read from the user.

‘C m’ (‘magit-clone-mirror’)
     This command creates a mirror of an existing repository.  The
     repository and the target directory are read from the user.

   The following suffixes are disabled by default.  See *note
(transient)Enabling and Disabling Suffixes:: for how to enable them.

‘C d’ (‘magit-clone-shallow-since’)
     This command creates a shallow clone of an existing repository.
     Only commits that were committed after a date are cloned, which is
     read from the user.  The repository and the target directory are
     also read from the user.

‘C e’ (‘magit-clone-shallow-exclude’)
     This command creates a shallow clone of an existing repository.
     This reads a branch or tag from the user.  Commits that are
     reachable from that are not cloned.  The repository and the target
     directory are also read from the user.

 -- User Option: magit-clone-set-remote-head
     This option controls whether cloning causes the reference
     ‘refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD’ to be created in the clone.  The
     default is to delete the reference after running ‘git clone’, which
     insists on creating it.  This is because the reference has not been
     found to be particularly useful as it is not automatically updated
     when the ‘HEAD’ of the remote changes.  Setting this option to ‘t’
     preserves Git’s default behavior of creating the reference.

 -- User Option: magit-clone-set-remote.pushDefault
     This option controls whether the value of the Git variable
     ‘remote.pushDefault’ is set after cloning.

        • If ‘t’, then it is always set without asking.
        • If ‘ask’, then the users are asked every time they clone a
          repository.
        • If ‘nil’, then it is never set.

 -- User Option: magit-clone-default-directory
     This option control the default directory name used when reading
     the destination for a cloning operation.

        • If ‘nil’ (the default), then the value of ‘default-directory’
          is used.
        • If a directory, then that is used.
        • If a function, then that is called with the remote url as the
          only argument and the returned value is used.

 -- User Option: magit-clone-name-alist
     This option maps regular expressions, which match repository names,
     to repository urls, making it possible for users to enter short
     names instead of urls when cloning repositories.

     Each element has the form ‘(REGEXP HOSTNAME USER)’.  When the user
     enters a name when a cloning command asks for a name or url, then
     that is looked up in this list.  The first element whose REGEXP
     matches is used.

     The format specified by option ‘magit-clone-url-format’ is used to
     turn the name into an url, using HOSTNAME and the repository name.
     If the provided name contains a slash, then that is used.
     Otherwise if the name omits the owner of the repository, then the
     default user specified in the matched entry is used.

     If USER contains a dot, then it is treated as a Git variable and
     the value of that is used as the username.  Otherwise it is used as
     the username itself.

 -- User Option: magit-clone-url-format
     The format specified by this option is used when turning repository
     names into urls.  ‘%h’ is the hostname and ‘%n’ is the repository
     name, including the name of the owner.  The value can be a string
     (representing a single static format) or an alist with elements
     ‘(HOSTNAME . FORMAT)’ mapping hostnames to formats.  When an alist
     is used, the ‘t’ key represents the default format.

     Example of a single format string:

          (setq magit-clone-url-format
                "git@%h:%n.git")

     Example of by-hostname format strings:

          (setq magit-clone-url-format
                '(("git.example.com" . "git@%h:~%n")
                  (nil . "git@%h:%n.git")))

 -- User Option: magit-post-clone-hook
     Hook run after the Git process has successfully finished cloning
     the repository.  When the hook is called, ‘default-directory’ is
     let-bound to the directory where the repository has been cloned.

6.3 Staging and Unstaging
=========================

Like Git, Magit can of course stage and unstage complete files.  Unlike
Git, it also allows users to gracefully un-/stage individual hunks and
even just part of a hunk.  To stage individual hunks and parts of hunks
using Git directly, one has to use the very modal and rather clumsy
interface of a ‘git add --interactive’ session.

   With Magit, on the other hand, one can un-/stage individual hunks by
just moving point into the respective section inside a diff displayed in
the status buffer or a separate diff buffer and typing ‘s’ or ‘u’.  To
operate on just parts of a hunk, mark the changes that should be
un-/staged using the region and then press the same key that would be
used to un-/stage.  To stage multiple files or hunks at once use a
region that starts inside the heading of such a section and ends inside
the heading of a sibling section of the same type.

   Besides staging and unstaging, Magit also provides several other
"apply variants" that can also operate on a file, multiple files at
once, a hunk, multiple hunks at once, and on parts of a hunk.  These
apply variants are described in the next section.

   You can also use Ediff to stage and unstage.  See *note Ediffing::.

‘s’ (‘magit-stage’)
     Add the change at point to the staging area.

     With a prefix argument and an untracked file (or files) at point,
     stage the file but not its content.  This makes it possible to
     stage only a subset of the new file’s changes.

‘S’ (‘magit-stage-modified’)
     Stage all changes to files modified in the worktree.  Stage all new
     content of tracked files and remove tracked files that no longer
     exist in the working tree from the index also.  With a prefix
     argument also stage previously untracked (but not ignored) files.

‘u’ (‘magit-unstage’)
     Remove the change at point from the staging area.

     Only staged changes can be unstaged.  But by default this command
     performs an action that is somewhat similar to unstaging, when it
     is called on a committed change: it reverses the change in the
     index but not in the working tree.

‘U’ (‘magit-unstage-all’)
     Remove all changes from the staging area.

 -- User Option: magit-unstage-committed
     This option controls whether ‘magit-unstage’ "unstages" committed
     changes by reversing them in the index but not the working tree.
     The alternative is to raise an error.

‘M-x magit-reverse-in-index’
     This command reverses the committed change at point in the index
     but not the working tree.  By default no key is bound directly to
     this command, but it is indirectly called when ‘u’
     (‘magit-unstage’) is pressed on a committed change.

     This allows extracting a change from ‘HEAD’, while leaving it in
     the working tree, so that it can later be committed using a
     separate commit.  A typical workflow would be:

       1. Optionally make sure that there are no uncommitted changes.
       2. Visit the ‘HEAD’ commit and navigate to the change that should
          not have been included in that commit.
       3. Type ‘u’ (‘magit-unstage’) to reverse it in the index.  This
          assumes that ‘magit-unstage-committed-changes’ is non-nil.
       4. Type ‘c e’ to extend ‘HEAD’ with the staged changes, including
          those that were already staged before.
       5. Optionally stage the remaining changes using ‘s’ or ‘S’ and
          then type ‘c c’ to create a new commit.

‘M-x magit-reset-index’
     Reset the index to some commit.  The commit is read from the user
     and defaults to the commit at point.  If there is no commit at
     point, then it defaults to ‘HEAD’.

* Staging from File-Visiting Buffers::


File: magit.info,  Node: Staging from File-Visiting Buffers,  Up: Staging and Unstaging

6.3.1 Staging from File-Visiting Buffers
----------------------------------------

Fine-grained un-/staging has to be done from the status or a diff
buffer, but it’s also possible to un-/stage all changes made to the file
visited in the current buffer right from inside that buffer.

‘M-x magit-stage-file’
     When invoked inside a file-visiting buffer, then stage all changes
     to that file.  In a Magit buffer, stage the file at point if any.
     Otherwise prompt for a file to be staged.  With a prefix argument
     always prompt the user for a file, even in a file-visiting buffer
     or when there is a file section at point.

‘M-x magit-unstage-file’
     When invoked inside a file-visiting buffer, then unstage all
     changes to that file.  In a Magit buffer, unstage the file at point
     if any.  Otherwise prompt for a file to be unstaged.  With a prefix
     argument always prompt the user for a file, even in a file-visiting
     buffer or when there is a file section at point.

6.4 Applying
============

Magit provides several "apply variants": stage, unstage, discard,
reverse, and "regular apply".  At least when operating on a hunk they
are all implemented using ‘git apply’, which is why they are called
"apply variants".

   • Stage.  Apply a change from the working tree to the index.  The
     change also remains in the working tree.

   • Unstage.  Remove a change from the index.  The change remains in
     the working tree.

   • Discard.  On a staged change, remove it from the working tree and
     the index.  On an unstaged change, remove it from the working tree
     only.

   • Reverse.  Reverse a change in the working tree.  Both committed and
     staged changes can be reversed.  Unstaged changes cannot be
     reversed.  Discard them instead.

   • Apply.  Apply a change to the working tree.  Both committed and
     staged changes can be applied.  Unstaged changes cannot be applied
     - as they already have been applied.

   The previous section described the staging and unstaging commands.
What follows are the commands which implement the remaining apply
variants.

‘a’ (‘magit-apply’)
     Apply the change at point to the working tree.

     With a prefix argument fallback to a 3-way merge.  Doing so causes
     the change to be applied to the index as well.

‘k’ (‘magit-discard’)
     Remove the change at point from the working tree.

     On a hunk or file with unresolved conflicts prompt which side to
     keep (while discarding the other).  If point is within the text of
     a side, then keep that side without prompting.

‘v’ (‘magit-reverse’)
     Reverse the change at point in the working tree.

     With a prefix argument fallback to a 3-way merge.  Doing so causes
     the change to be applied to the index as well.

   With a prefix argument all apply variants attempt a 3-way merge when
appropriate (i.e., when ‘git apply’ is used internally).

6.5 Committing
==============

When the user initiates a commit, Magit calls ‘git commit’ without any
arguments, so Git has to get it from the user.  It creates the file
‘.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG’ and then opens that file in an editor.  Magit
arranges for that editor to be the Emacsclient.  Once the user finishes
the editing session, the Emacsclient exits and Git creates the commit
using the file’s content as message.

File: magit.info,  Node: Initiating a Commit,  Next: Editing Commit Messages,  Up: Committing

6.5.1 Initiating a Commit
-------------------------

Also see *note (gitman)git-commit::.

‘c’ (‘magit-commit’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

‘c c’ (‘magit-commit-create’)
     Create a new commit on ‘HEAD’.  With a prefix argument amend to the
     commit at ‘HEAD’ instead.

‘c a’ (‘magit-commit-amend’)
     Amend the last commit.

‘c e’ (‘magit-commit-extend’)
     Amend the last commit, without editing the message.  With a prefix
     argument keep the committer date, otherwise change it.  The option
     ‘magit-commit-extend-override-date’ can be used to inverse the
     meaning of the prefix argument.

     Non-interactively respect the optional OVERRIDE-DATE argument and
     ignore the option.

‘c w’ (‘magit-commit-reword’)
     Reword the last commit, ignoring staged changes.  With a prefix
     argument keep the committer date, otherwise change it.  The option
     ‘magit-commit-reword-override-date’ can be used to inverse the
     meaning of the prefix argument.

     Non-interactively respect the optional OVERRIDE-DATE argument and
     ignore the option.

‘c f’ (‘magit-commit-fixup’)
     Create a fixup commit.

     With a prefix argument the target commit has to be confirmed.
     Otherwise the commit at point may be used without confirmation
     depending on the value of option ‘magit-commit-squash-confirm’.

‘c F’ (‘magit-commit-instant-fixup’)
     Create a fixup commit and instantly rebase.

‘c s’ (‘magit-commit-squash’)
     Create a squash commit, without editing the squash message.

     With a prefix argument the target commit has to be confirmed.
     Otherwise the commit at point may be used without confirmation
     depending on the value of option ‘magit-commit-squash-confirm’.

‘c S’ (‘magit-commit-instant-squash’)
     Create a squash commit and instantly rebase.

‘c A’ (‘magit-commit-augment’)
     Create a squash commit, editing the squash message.

     With a prefix argument the target commit has to be confirmed.
     Otherwise the commit at point may be used without confirmation
     depending on the value of option ‘magit-commit-squash-confirm’.

 -- User Option: magit-commit-ask-to-stage
     Whether to ask to stage all unstaged changes when committing and
     nothing is staged.

 -- User Option: magit-commit-show-diff
     Whether the relevant diff is automatically shown when committing.

 -- User Option: magit-commit-extend-override-date
     Whether using ‘magit-commit-extend’ changes the committer date.

 -- User Option: magit-commit-reword-override-date
     Whether using ‘magit-commit-reword’ changes the committer date.

 -- User Option: magit-commit-squash-confirm
     Whether the commit targeted by squash and fixup has to be
     confirmed.  When non-nil then the commit at point (if any) is used
     as default choice.  Otherwise it has to be confirmed.  This option
     only affects ‘magit-commit-squash’ and ‘magit-commit-fixup’.  The
     "instant" variants always require confirmation because making an
     error while using those is harder to recover from.

 -- User Option: magit-post-commit-hook
     Hook run after creating a commit without the user editing a
     message.

     This hook is run by ‘magit-refresh’ if ‘this-command’ is a member
     of ‘magit-post-commit-hook-commands’.  This only includes commands
     named ‘magit-commit-*’ that do *not* require that the user edits
     the commit message in a buffer.

     Also see ‘git-commit-post-finish-hook’.

 -- User Option: magit-commit-diff-inhibit-same-window
     Whether to inhibit use of same window when showing diff while
     committing.

     When writing a commit, then a diff of the changes to be committed
     is automatically shown.  The idea is that the diff is shown in a
     different window of the same frame and for most users that just
     works.  In other words most users can completely ignore this option
     because its value doesn’t make a difference for them.

     However for users who configured Emacs to never create a new window
     even when the package explicitly tries to do so, then displaying
     two new buffers necessarily means that the first is immediately
     replaced by the second.  In our case the message buffer is
     immediately replaced by the diff buffer, which is of course highly
     undesirable.

     A workaround is to suppress this user configuration in this
     particular case.  Users have to explicitly opt-in by toggling this
     option.  We cannot enable the workaround unconditionally because
     that again causes issues for other users: if the frame is too tiny
     or the relevant settings too aggressive, then the diff buffer would
     end up being displayed in a new frame.

     Also see <https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/4132>.


File: magit.info,  Node: Editing Commit Messages,  Prev: Initiating a Commit,  Up: Committing

6.5.2 Editing Commit Messages
-----------------------------

After initiating a commit as described in the previous section, two new
buffers appear.  One shows the changes that are about to be committed,
while the other is used to write the message.

   Commit messages are edited in an edit session - in the background
‘git’ is waiting for the editor, in our case ‘emacsclient’, to save the
commit message in a file (in most cases ‘.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG’) and then
return.  If the editor returns with a non-zero exit status then ‘git’
does not create the commit.  So the most important commands are those
for finishing and aborting the commit.

‘C-c C-c’ (‘with-editor-finish’)
     Finish the current editing session by returning with exit code 0.
     Git then creates the commit using the message it finds in the file.

‘C-c C-k’ (‘with-editor-cancel’)
     Cancel the current editing session by returning with exit code 1.
     Git then cancels the commit, but leaves the file untouched.

   In addition to being used by ‘git commit’, messages may also be
stored in a ring that persists until Emacs is closed.  By default the
message is stored at the beginning and the end of an edit session
(regardless of whether the session is finished successfully or was
canceled).  It is sometimes useful to bring back messages from that
ring.

‘C-c M-s’ (‘git-commit-save-message’)
     Save the current buffer content to the commit message ring.

‘M-p’ (‘git-commit-prev-message’)
     Cycle backward through the commit message ring, after saving the
     current message to the ring.  With a numeric prefix ARG, go back
     ARG comments.

‘M-n’ (‘git-commit-next-message’)
     Cycle forward through the commit message ring, after saving the
     current message to the ring.  With a numeric prefix ARG, go back
     ARG comments.

   By default the diff for the changes that are about to be committed
are automatically shown when invoking the commit.  To prevent that,
remove ‘magit-commit-diff’ from ‘server-switch-hook’.

   When amending to an existing commit it may be useful to show either
the changes that are about to be added to that commit or to show those
changes alongside those that have already been committed.

‘C-c C-d’ (‘magit-diff-while-committing’)
     While committing, show the changes that are about to be committed.
     While amending, invoking the command again toggles between showing
     just the new changes or all the changes that will be committed.

........................

‘C-c C-w’ (‘magit-pop-revision-stack’)
     This command inserts a representation of a revision into the
     current buffer.  It can be used inside buffers used to write commit
     messages but also in other buffers such as buffers used to edit
     emails or ChangeLog files.

     By default this command pops the revision which was last added to
     the ‘magit-revision-stack’ and inserts it into the current buffer
     according to ‘magit-pop-revision-stack-format’.  Revisions can be
     put on the stack using ‘magit-copy-section-value’ and
     ‘magit-copy-buffer-revision’.

     If the stack is empty or with a prefix argument it instead reads a
     revision in the minibuffer.  By using the minibuffer history this
     allows selecting an item which was popped earlier or to insert an
     arbitrary reference or revision without first pushing it onto the
     stack.

     When reading the revision from the minibuffer, then it might not be
     possible to guess the correct repository.  When this command is
     called inside a repository (e.g., while composing a commit
     message), then that repository is used.  Otherwise (e.g., while
     composing an email) then the repository recorded for the top
     element of the stack is used (even though we insert another
     revision).  If not called inside a repository and with an empty
     stack, or with two prefix arguments, then read the repository in
     the minibuffer too.

 -- User Option: magit-pop-revision-stack-format
     This option controls how the command ‘magit-pop-revision-stack’
     inserts a revision into the current buffer.

     The entries on the stack have the format ‘(HASH TOPLEVEL)’ and this
     option has the format ‘(POINT-FORMAT EOB-FORMAT INDEX-REGEXP)’, all
     of which may be nil or a string (though either one of EOB-FORMAT or
     POINT-FORMAT should be a string, and if INDEX-REGEXP is non-nil,
     then the two formats should be too).

     First INDEX-REGEXP is used to find the previously inserted entry,
     by searching backward from point.  The first submatch must match
     the index number.  That number is incremented by one, and becomes
     the index number of the entry to be inserted.  If you don’t want to
     number the inserted revisions, then use nil for INDEX-REGEXP.

     If INDEX-REGEXP is non-nil then both POINT-FORMAT and EOB-FORMAT
     should contain \"%N\", which is replaced with the number that was
     determined in the previous step.

     Both formats, if non-nil and after removing %N, are then expanded
     using ‘git show --format=FORMAT ...’ inside TOPLEVEL.

     The expansion of POINT-FORMAT is inserted at point, and the
     expansion of EOB-FORMAT is inserted at the end of the buffer (if
     the buffer ends with a comment, then it is inserted right before
     that).

Commit Pseudo Headers
.....................

Some projects use pseudo headers in commit messages.  Magit colorizes
such headers and provides some commands to insert such headers.

 -- User Option: git-commit-known-pseudo-headers
     A list of Git pseudo headers to be highlighted.

‘C-c C-i’ (‘git-commit-insert-pseudo-header’)
     Insert a commit message pseudo header.

‘C-c C-a’ (‘git-commit-ack’)
     Insert a header acknowledging that you have looked at the commit.

‘C-c C-r’ (‘git-commit-review’)
     Insert a header acknowledging that you have reviewed the commit.

‘C-c C-s’ (‘git-commit-signoff’)
     Insert a header to sign off the commit.

‘C-c C-t’ (‘git-commit-test’)
     Insert a header acknowledging that you have tested the commit.

‘C-c C-o’ (‘git-commit-cc’)
     Insert a header mentioning someone who might be interested.

‘C-c C-p’ (‘git-commit-reported’)
     Insert a header mentioning the person who reported the issue being
     fixed by the commit.

‘C-c M-i’ (‘git-commit-suggested’)
     Insert a header mentioning the person who suggested the change.

Commit Mode and Hooks
.....................

‘git-commit-mode’ is a minor mode that is only used to establish certain
key bindings.  This makes it possible to use an arbitrary major mode in
buffers used to edit commit messages.  It is even possible to use
different major modes in different repositories, which is useful when
different projects impose different commit message conventions.

 -- User Option: git-commit-major-mode
     The value of this option is the major mode used to edit Git commit
     messages.

   Because ‘git-commit-mode’ is a minor mode, we don’t use its mode hook
to setup the buffer, except for the key bindings.  All other setup
happens in the function ‘git-commit-setup’, which among other things
runs the hook ‘git-commit-setup-hook’.

 -- User Option: git-commit-setup-hook
     Hook run at the end of ‘git-commit-setup’.

The following functions are suitable for this hook:

 -- Function: git-commit-save-message
     Save the current buffer content to the commit message ring.

 -- Function: git-commit-setup-changelog-support
     After this function is called, ChangeLog entries are treated as
     paragraphs.

 -- Function: git-commit-turn-on-auto-fill
     Turn on ‘auto-fill-mode’.

 -- Function: git-commit-turn-on-flyspell
     Turn on Flyspell mode.  Also prevent comments from being checked
     and finally check current non-comment text.

 -- Function: git-commit-propertize-diff
     Propertize the diff shown inside the commit message buffer.  Git
     inserts such diffs into the commit message template when the
     ‘--verbose’ argument is used.  ‘magit-commit’ by default does not
     offer that argument because the diff that is shown in a separate
     buffer is more useful.  But some users disagree, which is why this
     function exists.

 -- Function: bug-reference-mode
     Hyperlink bug references in the buffer.

 -- Function: with-editor-usage-message
     Show usage information in the echo area.

 -- User Option: git-commit-post-finish-hook
     Hook run after the user finished writing a commit message.

     This hook is only run after pressing ‘C-c C-c’ in a buffer used to
     edit a commit message.  If a commit is created without the user
     typing a message into a buffer, then this hook is not run.

     This hook is not run until the new commit has been created.  If
     doing so takes Git longer than one second, then this hook isn’t run
     at all.  For certain commands such as ‘magit-rebase-continue’ this
     hook is never run because doing so would lead to a race condition.

     This hook is only run if ‘magit’ is available.

     Also see ‘magit-post-commit-hook’.

Commit Message Conventions
..........................

Git-Commit highlights certain violations of commonly accepted commit
message conventions.  Certain violations even cause Git-Commit to ask
you to confirm that you really want to do that.  This nagging can of
course be turned off, but the result of doing that usually is that
instead of some code it’s now the human who is reviewing your commits
who has to waste some time telling you to fix your commits.

 -- User Option: git-commit-summary-max-length
     The intended maximal length of the summary line of commit messages.
     Characters beyond this column are colorized to indicate that this
     preference has been violated.

 -- User Option: git-commit-finish-query-functions
     List of functions called to query before performing commit.

     The commit message buffer is current while the functions are
     called.  If any of them returns nil, then the commit is not
     performed and the buffer is not killed.  The user should then fix
     the issue and try again.

     The functions are called with one argument.  If it is non-nil then
     that indicates that the user used a prefix argument to force
     finishing the session despite issues.  Functions should usually
     honor this wish and return non-nil.

     By default the only member is ‘git-commit-check-style-conventions’.

 -- Function: git-commit-check-style-conventions
     This function checks for violations of certain basic style
     conventions.  For each violation it asks users if they want to
     proceed anyway.

 -- User Option: git-commit-style-convention-checks
     This option controls what conventions the function by the same name
     tries to enforce.  The value is a list of self-explanatory symbols
     identifying certain conventions; ‘non-empty-second-line’ and
     ‘overlong-summary-line’.

File: magit.info,  Node: The Two Remotes,  Next: Branch Commands,  Up: Branching

6.6.1 The Two Remotes
---------------------

The upstream branch of some local branch is the branch into which the
commits on that local branch should eventually be merged, usually
something like ‘origin/master’.  For the ‘master’ branch itself the
upstream branch and the branch it is being pushed to, are usually the
same remote branch.  But for a feature branch the upstream branch and
the branch it is being pushed to should differ.

   The commits on feature branches too should _eventually_ end up in a
remote branch such as ‘origin/master’ or ‘origin/maint’.  Such a branch
should therefore be used as the upstream.  But feature branches
shouldn’t be pushed directly to such branches.  Instead a feature branch
‘my-feature’ is usually pushed to ‘my-fork/my-feature’ or if you are a
contributor ‘origin/my-feature’.  After the new feature has been
reviewed, the maintainer merges the feature into ‘master’.  And finally
‘master’ (not ‘my-feature’ itself) is pushed to ‘origin/master’.

   But new features seldom are perfect on the first try, and so feature
branches usually have to be reviewed, improved, and re-pushed several
times.  Pushing should therefore be easy to do, and for that reason many
Git users have concluded that it is best to use the remote branch to
which the local feature branch is being pushed as its upstream.

   But luckily Git has long ago gained support for a push-remote which
can be configured separately from the upstream branch, using the
variables ‘branch.<name>.pushRemote’ and ‘remote.pushDefault’.  So we no
longer have to choose which of the two remotes should be used as "the
remote".

   Each of the fetching, pulling, and pushing transient commands
features three suffix commands that act on the current branch and some
other branch.  Of these, ‘p’ is bound to a command which acts on the
push-remote, ‘u’ is bound to a command which acts on the upstream, and
‘e’ is bound to a command which acts on any other branch.  The status
buffer shows unpushed and unpulled commits for both the push-remote and
the upstream.

   It’s fairly simple to configure these two remotes.  The values of all
the variables that are related to fetching, pulling, and pushing (as
well as some other branch-related variables) can be inspected and
changed using the command ‘magit-branch-configure’, which is available
from many transient prefix commands that deal with branches.  It is also
possible to set the push-remote or upstream while pushing (see *note
Pushing::).


File: magit.info,  Node: Branch Commands,  Next: Branch Git Variables,  Prev: The Two Remotes,  Up: Branching

6.6.2 Branch Commands
---------------------

The transient prefix command ‘magit-branch’ is used to create and
checkout branches, and to make changes to existing branches.  It is not
used to fetch, pull, merge, rebase, or push branches, i.e., this command
deals with branches themselves, not with the commits reachable from
them.  Those features are available from separate transient command.

‘b’ (‘magit-branch’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     and displays them in a temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

     By default it also binds and displays the values of some
     branch-related Git variables and allows changing their values.

 -- User Option: magit-branch-direct-configure
     This option controls whether the transient command ‘magit-branch’
     can be used to directly change the values of Git variables.  This
     defaults to ‘t’ (to avoid changing key bindings).  When set to
     ‘nil’, then no variables are displayed by that transient command,
     and its suffix command ‘magit-branch-configure’ has to be used
     instead to view and change branch related variables.

‘b C’ (‘magit-branch-configure’)
‘f C’
‘F C’
‘P C’
     This transient prefix command binds commands that set the value of
     branch-related variables and displays them in a temporary buffer
     until the transient is exited.

     With a prefix argument, this command always prompts for a branch.

     Without a prefix argument this depends on whether it was invoked as
     a suffix of ‘magit-branch’ and on the
     ‘magit-branch-direct-configure’ option.  If ‘magit-branch’ already
     displays the variables for the current branch, then it isn’t useful
     to invoke another transient that displays them for the same branch.
     In that case this command prompts for a branch.

   The variables are described in *note Branch Git Variables::.

‘b b’ (‘magit-checkout’)
     Checkout a revision read in the minibuffer and defaulting to the
     branch or arbitrary revision at point.  If the revision is a local
     branch then that becomes the current branch.  If it is something
     else then ‘HEAD’ becomes detached.  Checkout fails if the working
     tree or the staging area contain changes.

‘b n’ (‘magit-branch-create’)
     Create a new branch.  The user is asked for a branch or arbitrary
     revision to use as the starting point of the new branch.  When a
     branch name is provided, then that becomes the upstream branch of
     the new branch.  The name of the new branch is also read in the
     minibuffer.

     Also see option ‘magit-branch-prefer-remote-upstream’.

‘b c’ (‘magit-branch-and-checkout’)
     This command creates a new branch like ‘magit-branch-create’, but
     then also checks it out.

     Also see option ‘magit-branch-prefer-remote-upstream’.

‘b l’ (‘magit-branch-checkout’)
     This command checks out an existing or new local branch.  It reads
     a branch name from the user offering all local branches and a
     subset of remote branches as candidates.  Remote branches for which
     a local branch by the same name exists are omitted from the list of
     candidates.  The user can also enter a completely new branch name.

        • If the user selects an existing local branch, then that is
          checked out.

        • If the user selects a remote branch, then it creates and
          checks out a new local branch with the same name, and
          configures the selected remote branch as the push target.

        • If the user enters a new branch name, then it creates and
          checks that out, after also reading the starting-point from
          the user.

     In the latter two cases the upstream is also set.  Whether it is
     set to the chosen starting point or something else depends on the
     value of ‘magit-branch-adjust-remote-upstream-alist’.

‘b s’ (‘magit-branch-spinoff’)
     This command creates and checks out a new branch starting at and
     tracking the current branch.  That branch in turn is reset to the
     last commit it shares with its upstream.  If the current branch has
     no upstream or no unpushed commits, then the new branch is created
     anyway and the previously current branch is not touched.

     This is useful to create a feature branch after work has already
     began on the old branch (likely but not necessarily "master").

     If the current branch is a member of the value of option
     ‘magit-branch-prefer-remote-upstream’ (which see), then the current
     branch will be used as the starting point as usual, but the
     upstream of the starting-point may be used as the upstream of the
     new branch, instead of the starting-point itself.

     If optional FROM is non-nil, then the source branch is reset to
     ‘FROM~’, instead of to the last commit it shares with its upstream.
     Interactively, FROM is only ever non-nil, if the region selects
     some commits, and among those commits, FROM is the commit that is
     the fewest commits ahead of the source branch.

     The commit at the other end of the selection actually does not
     matter, all commits between FROM and ‘HEAD’ are moved to the new
     branch.  If FROM is not reachable from ‘HEAD’ or is reachable from
     the source branch’s upstream, then an error is raised.

‘b S’ (‘magit-branch-spinout’)
     This command behaves like ‘magit-branch-spinoff’, except that it
     does not change the current branch.  If there are any uncommitted
     changes, then it behaves exactly like ‘magit-branch-spinoff’.

‘b x’ (‘magit-branch-reset’)
     This command resets a branch, defaulting to the branch at point, to
     the tip of another branch or any other commit.

     When the branch being reset is the current branch, then a hard
     reset is performed.  If there are any uncommitted changes, then the
     user has to confirm the reset because those changes would be lost.

     This is useful when you have started work on a feature branch but
     realize it’s all crap and want to start over.

     When resetting to another branch and a prefix argument is used,
     then the target branch is set as the upstream of the branch that is
     being reset.

‘b k’ (‘magit-branch-delete’)
     Delete one or multiple branches.  If the region marks multiple
     branches, then offer to delete those.  Otherwise, prompt for a
     single branch to be deleted, defaulting to the branch at point.

     Require confirmation when deleting branches is dangerous in some
     way.  Option ‘magit-no-confirm’ can be customized to not require
     confirmation in certain cases.  See its docstring to learn why
     confirmation is required by default in certain cases or if a prompt
     is confusing.

‘b m’ (‘magit-branch-rename’)
     Rename a branch.  The branch and the new name are read in the
     minibuffer.  With prefix argument the branch is renamed even if
     that name conflicts with an existing branch.

 -- User Option: magit-branch-read-upstream-first
     When creating a branch, whether to read the upstream branch before
     the name of the branch that is to be created.  The default is ‘t’,
     and I recommend you leave it at that.

 -- User Option: magit-branch-prefer-remote-upstream
     This option specifies whether remote upstreams are favored over
     local upstreams when creating new branches.

     When a new branch is created, then the branch, commit, or stash at
     point is suggested as the starting point of the new branch, or if
     there is no such revision at point the current branch.  In either
     case the user may choose another starting point.

     If the chosen starting point is a branch, then it may also be set
     as the upstream of the new branch, depending on the value of the
     Git variable ‘branch.autoSetupMerge’.  By default this is done for
     remote branches, but not for local branches.

     You might prefer to always use some remote branch as upstream.  If
     the chosen starting point is (1) a local branch, (2) whose name
     matches a member of the value of this option, (3) the upstream of
     that local branch is a remote branch with the same name, and (4)
     that remote branch can be fast-forwarded to the local branch, then
     the chosen branch is used as starting point, but its own upstream
     is used as the upstream of the new branch.

     Members of this option’s value are treated as branch names that
     have to match exactly unless they contain a character that makes
     them invalid as a branch name.  Recommended characters to use to
     trigger interpretation as a regexp are "*" and "^".  Some other
     characters which you might expect to be invalid, actually are not,
     e.g., ".+$" are all perfectly valid.  More precisely, if ‘git
     check-ref-format --branch STRING’ exits with a non-zero status,
     then treat STRING as a regexp.

     Assuming the chosen branch matches these conditions you would end
     up with with e.g.:

          feature --upstream--> origin/master

     instead of

          feature --upstream--> master --upstream--> origin/master

     Which you prefer is a matter of personal preference.  If you do
     prefer the former, then you should add branches such as ‘master’,
     ‘next’, and ‘maint’ to the value of this options.

 -- User Option: magit-branch-adjust-remote-upstream-alist
     The value of this option is an alist of branches to be used as the
     upstream when branching a remote branch.

     When creating a local branch from an ephemeral branch located on a
     remote, e.g., a feature or hotfix branch, then that remote branch
     should usually not be used as the upstream branch, since the
     push-remote already allows accessing it and having both the
     upstream and the push-remote reference the same related branch
     would be wasteful.  Instead a branch like "maint" or "master"
     should be used as the upstream.

     This option allows specifying the branch that should be used as the
     upstream when branching certain remote branches.  The value is an
     alist of the form ‘((UPSTREAM . RULE)...)’.  The first matching
     element is used, the following elements are ignored.

     UPSTREAM is the branch to be used as the upstream for branches
     specified by RULE.  It can be a local or a remote branch.

     RULE can either be a regular expression, matching branches whose
     upstream should be the one specified by UPSTREAM.  Or it can be a
     list of the only branches that should *not* use UPSTREAM; all other
     branches will.  Matching is done after stripping the remote part of
     the name of the branch that is being branched from.

     If you use a finite set of non-ephemeral branches across all your
     repositories, then you might use something like:

          (("origin/master" . ("master" "next" "maint")))

     Or if the names of all your ephemeral branches contain a slash, at
     least in some repositories, then a good value could be:

          (("origin/master" . "/"))

     Of course you can also fine-tune:

          (("origin/maint" . "\\`hotfix/")
           ("origin/master" . "\\`feature/"))

     UPSTREAM can be a local branch:

          (("master" . ("master" "next" "maint")))

   Because the main branch is no longer almost always named "master" you
should also account for other common names:

     (("main"  . ("main" "master" "next" "maint"))
      ("master" . ("main" "master" "next" "maint")))

 -- Command: magit-branch-orphan
     This command creates and checks out a new orphan branch with
     contents from a given revision.

 -- Command: magit-branch-or-checkout
     This command is a hybrid between ‘magit-checkout’ and
     ‘magit-branch-and-checkout’ and is intended as a replacement for
     the former in ‘magit-branch’.

     It first asks the user for an existing branch or revision.  If the
     user input actually can be resolved as a branch or revision, then
     it checks that out, just like ‘magit-checkout’ would.

     Otherwise it creates and checks out a new branch using the input as
     its name.  Before doing so it reads the starting-point for the new
     branch.  This is similar to what ‘magit-branch-and-checkout’ does.

     To use this command instead of ‘magit-checkout’ add this to your
     init file:

          (transient-replace-suffix 'magit-branch 'magit-checkout
            '("b" "dwim" magit-branch-or-checkout))

6.6.3 Branch Git Variables
--------------------------

These variables can be set from the transient prefix command
‘magit-branch-configure’.  By default they can also be set from
‘magit-branch’.  See *note Branch Commands::.

 -- Variable: branch.NAME.merge
     Together with ‘branch.NAME.remote’ this variable defines the
     upstream branch of the local branch named NAME.  The value of this
     variable is the full reference of the upstream _branch_.

 -- Variable: branch.NAME.remote
     Together with ‘branch.NAME.merge’ this variable defines the
     upstream branch of the local branch named NAME.  The value of this
     variable is the name of the upstream _remote_.

 -- Variable: branch.NAME.rebase
     This variable controls whether pulling into the branch named NAME
     is done by rebasing or by merging the fetched branch.

        • When ‘true’ then pulling is done by rebasing.
        • When ‘false’ then pulling is done by merging.
        • When undefined then the value of ‘pull.rebase’ is used.  The
          default of that variable is ‘false’.

 -- Variable: branch.NAME.pushRemote
     This variable specifies the remote that the branch named NAME is
     usually pushed to.  The value has to be the name of an existing
     remote.

     It is not possible to specify the name of _branch_ to push the
     local branch to.  The name of the remote branch is always the same
     as the name of the local branch.

     If this variable is undefined but ‘remote.pushDefault’ is defined,
     then the value of the latter is used.  By default
     ‘remote.pushDefault’ is undefined.

 -- Variable: branch.NAME.description
     This variable can be used to describe the branch named NAME.  That
     description is used, e.g., when turning the branch into a series of
     patches.

   The following variables specify defaults which are used if the above
branch-specific variables are not set.

 -- Variable: pull.rebase
     This variable specifies whether pulling is done by rebasing or by
     merging.  It can be overwritten using ‘branch.NAME.rebase’.

        • When ‘true’ then pulling is done by rebasing.
        • When ‘false’ (the default) then pulling is done by merging.

     Since it is never a good idea to merge the upstream branch into a
     feature or hotfix branch and most branches are such branches, you
     should consider setting this to ‘true’, and ‘branch.master.rebase’
     to ‘false’.

 -- Variable: remote.pushDefault
     This variable specifies what remote the local branches are usually
     pushed to.  This can be overwritten per branch using
     ‘branch.NAME.pushRemote’.

   The following variables are used during the creation of a branch and
control whether the various branch-specific variables are automatically
set at this time.

 -- Variable: branch.autoSetupMerge
     This variable specifies under what circumstances creating a branch
     NAME should result in the variables ‘branch.NAME.merge’ and
     ‘branch.NAME.remote’ being set according to the starting point used
     to create the branch.  If the starting point isn’t a branch, then
     these variables are never set.

        • When ‘always’ then the variables are set regardless of whether
          the starting point is a local or a remote branch.
        • When ‘true’ (the default) then the variables are set when the
          starting point is a remote branch, but not when it is a local
          branch.
        • When ‘false’ then the variables are never set.

 -- Variable: branch.autoSetupRebase
     This variable specifies whether creating a branch NAME should
     result in the variable ‘branch.NAME.rebase’ being set to ‘true’.

        • When ‘always’ then the variable is set regardless of whether
          the starting point is a local or a remote branch.
        • When ‘local’ then the variable are set when the starting point
          is a local branch, but not when it is a remote branch.
        • When ‘remote’ then the variable are set when the starting
          point is a remote branch, but not when it is a local branch.
        • When ‘never’ (the default) then the variable is never set.

   Note that the respective commands always change the repository-local
values.  If you want to change the global value, which is used when the
local value is undefined, then you have to do so on the command line,
e.g.:

     git config --global remote.autoSetupMerge always

   For more information about these variables you should also see

   *note (gitman)git-config::.  Also see *note (gitman)git-branch::.  ,
*note (gitman)git-checkout::.  and *note Pushing::.

 -- User Option: magit-prefer-remote-upstream
     This option controls whether commands that read a branch from the
     user and then set it as the upstream branch, offer a local or a
     remote branch as default completion candidate, when they have the
     choice.

     This affects all commands that use ‘magit-read-upstream-branch’ or
     ‘magit-read-starting-point’, which includes all commands that
     change the upstream and many which create new branches.

6.6.4 Auxiliary Branch Commands
-------------------------------

These commands are not available from the transient ‘magit-branch’ by
default.

 -- Command: magit-branch-shelve
     This command shelves a branch.  This is done by deleting the
     branch, and creating a new reference "refs/shelved/BRANCH-NAME"
     pointing at the same commit as the branch pointed at.  If the
     deleted branch had a reflog, then that is preserved as the reflog
     of the new reference.

     This is useful if you want to move a branch out of sight, but are
     not ready to completely discard it yet.

 -- Command: magit-branch-unshelve
     This command unshelves a branch that was previously shelved using
     ‘magit-branch-shelve’.  This is done by deleting the reference
     "refs/shelved/BRANCH-NAME" and creating a branch "BRANCH-NAME"
     pointing at the same commit as the deleted reference pointed at.
     If the deleted reference had a reflog, then that is restored as the
     reflog of the branch.

6.7 Merging
===========

Also see *note (gitman)git-merge::.  For information on how to resolve
merge conflicts see the next section.

‘m’ (‘magit-merge’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

   When no merge is in progress, then the transient features the
following suffix commands.

‘m m’ (‘magit-merge-plain’)
     This command merges another branch or an arbitrary revision into
     the current branch.  The branch or revision to be merged is read in
     the minibuffer and defaults to the branch at point.

     Unless there are conflicts or a prefix argument is used, then the
     resulting merge commit uses a generic commit message, and the user
     does not get a chance to inspect or change it before the commit is
     created.  With a prefix argument this does not actually create the
     merge commit, which makes it possible to inspect how conflicts were
     resolved and to adjust the commit message.

‘m e’ (‘magit-merge-editmsg’)
     This command merges another branch or an arbitrary revision into
     the current branch and opens a commit message buffer, so that the
     user can make adjustments.  The commit is not actually created
     until the user finishes with ‘C-c C-c’.

‘m n’ (‘magit-merge-nocommit’)
     This command merges another branch or an arbitrary revision into
     the current branch, but does not actually create the merge commit.
     The user can then further adjust the merge, even when automatic
     conflict resolution succeeded and/or adjust the commit message.

‘m a’ (‘magit-merge-absorb’)
     This command merges another local branch into the current branch
     and then removes the former.

     Before the source branch is merged, it is first force pushed to its
     push-remote, provided the respective remote branch already exists.
     This ensures that the respective pull-request (if any) won’t get
     stuck on some obsolete version of the commits that are being
     merged.  Finally, if ‘magit-branch-pull-request’ was used to create
     the merged branch, then the respective remote branch is also
     removed.

‘m i’ (‘magit-merge-into’)
     This command merges the current branch into another local branch
     and then removes the former.  The latter becomes the new current
     branch.

     Before the source branch is merged, it is first force pushed to its
     push-remote, provided the respective remote branch already exists.
     This ensures that the respective pull-request (if any) won’t get
     stuck on some obsolete version of the commits that are being
     merged.  Finally, if ‘magit-branch-pull-request’ was used to create
     the merged branch, then the respective remote branch is also
     removed.

‘m s’ (‘magit-merge-squash’)
     This command squashes the changes introduced by another branch or
     an arbitrary revision into the current branch.  This only applies
     the changes made by the squashed commits.  No information is
     preserved that would allow creating an actual merge commit.
     Instead of this command you should probably use a command from the
     apply transient.

‘m p’ (‘magit-merge-preview’)
     This command shows a preview of merging another branch or an
     arbitrary revision into the current branch.

     Note that commands, that normally change how a diff is displayed,
     do not work in buffers created by this command, because the
     underlying Git command does not support diff arguments.

   When a merge is in progress, then the transient instead features the
following suffix commands.

‘m m’ (‘magit-merge’)
     After the user resolved conflicts, this command proceeds with the
     merge.  If some conflicts weren’t resolved, then this command
     fails.

‘m a’ (‘magit-merge-abort’)
     This command aborts the current merge operation.


File: magit.info,  Node: Resolving Conflicts,  Next: Rebasing,  Prev: Merging,  Up: Manipulating

6.8 Resolving Conflicts
=======================

When merging branches (or otherwise combining or changing history)
conflicts can occur.  If you edited two completely different parts of
the same file in two branches and then merge one of these branches into
the other, then Git can resolve that on its own, but if you edit the
same area of a file, then a human is required to decide how the two
versions, or "sides of the conflict", are to be combined into one.

   Here we can only provide a brief introduction to the subject and
point you toward some tools that can help.  If you are new to this, then
please also consult Git’s own documentation as well as other resources.

   If a file has conflicts and Git cannot resolve them by itself, then
it puts both versions into the affected file along with special markers
whose purpose is to denote the boundaries of the unresolved part of the
file and between the different versions.  These boundary lines begin
with the strings consisting of seven times the same character, one of
‘<’, ‘|’, ‘=’ and ‘>’, and are followed by information about the source
of the respective versions, e.g.:

     <<<<<<< HEAD
     Take the blue pill.
     =======
     Take the red pill.
     >>>>>>> feature

   In this case you have chosen to take the red pill on one branch and
on another you picked the blue pill.  Now that you are merging these two
diverging branches, Git cannot possibly know which pill you want to
take.

   To resolve that conflict you have to create a version of the affected
area of the file by keeping only one of the sides, possibly by editing
it in order to bring in the changes from the other side, remove the
other versions as well as the markers, and then stage the result.  A
possible resolution might be:

     Take both pills.

   Often it is useful to see not only the two sides of the conflict but
also the "original" version from before the same area of the file was
modified twice on different branches.  Instruct Git to insert that
version as well by running this command once:

     git config --global merge.conflictStyle diff3

   The above conflict might then have looked like this:

     <<<<<<< HEAD
     Take the blue pill.
     ||||||| merged common ancestors
     Take either the blue or the red pill, but not both.
     =======
     Take the red pill.
     >>>>>>> feature

   If that were the case, then the above conflict resolution would not
have been correct, which demonstrates why seeing the original version
alongside the conflicting versions can be useful.

   You can perform the conflict resolution completely by hand, but Emacs
also provides some packages that help in the process: Smerge, Ediff
(*note (ediff)Top::), and Emerge (*note (emacs)Emerge::).  Magit does
not provide its own tools for conflict resolution, but it does make
using Smerge and Ediff more convenient.  (Ediff supersedes Emerge, so
you probably don’t want to use the latter anyway.)

   In the Magit status buffer, files with unresolved conflicts are
listed in the "Unstaged changes" and/or "Staged changes" sections.  They
are prefixed with the word "unmerged", which in this context essentially
is a synonym for "unresolved".

   Pressing ‘RET’ while point is on such a file section shows a buffer
visiting that file, turns on ‘smerge-mode’ in that buffer, and places
point inside the first area with conflicts.  You should then resolve
that conflict using regular edit commands and/or Smerge commands.

   Unfortunately Smerge does not have a manual, but you can get a list
of commands and binding ‘C-c ^ C-h’ and press ‘RET’ while point is on a
command name to read its documentation.

   Normally you would edit one version and then tell Smerge to keep only
that version.  Use ‘C-c ^ m’ (‘smerge-keep-mine’) to keep the ‘HEAD’
version or ‘C-c ^ o’ (‘smerge-keep-other’) to keep the version that
follows "|||||||".  Then use ‘C-c ^ n’ to move to the next conflicting
area in the same file.  Once you are done resolving conflicts, return to
the Magit status buffer.  The file should now be shown as "modified", no
longer as "unmerged", because Smerge automatically stages the file when
you save the buffer after resolving the last conflict.

   Magit now wraps the mentioned Smerge commands, allowing you to use
these key bindings without having to go to the file-visiting buffer.
Additionally ‘k’ (‘magit-discard’) on a hunk with unresolved conflicts
asks which side to keep or, if point is on a side, then it keeps it
without prompting.  Similarly ‘k’ on a unresolved file ask which side to
keep.

   Alternatively you could use Ediff, which uses separate buffers for
the different versions of the file.  To resolve conflicts in a file
using Ediff press ‘e’ while point is on such a file in the status
buffer.

   Ediff can be used for other purposes as well.  For more information
on how to enter Ediff from Magit, see *note Ediffing::.  Explaining how
to use Ediff is beyond the scope of this manual, instead see *note
(ediff)Top::.

   If you are unsure whether you should Smerge or Ediff, then use the
former.  It is much easier to understand and use, and except for truly
complex conflicts, the latter is usually overkill.

6.9 Rebasing
============

Also see *note (gitman)git-rebase::.  For information on how to resolve
conflicts that occur during rebases see the preceding section.

‘r’ (‘magit-rebase’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

   When no rebase is in progress, then the transient features the
following suffix commands.

   Using one of these commands _starts_ a rebase sequence.  Git might
then stop somewhere along the way, either because you told it to do so,
or because applying a commit failed due to a conflict.  When that
happens, then the status buffer shows information about the rebase
sequence which is in progress in a section similar to a log section.
See *note Information About In-Progress Rebase::.

   For information about the upstream and the push-remote, see *note The
Two Remotes::.

‘r p’ (‘magit-rebase-onto-pushremote’)
     This command rebases the current branch onto its push-remote.

     With a prefix argument or when the push-remote is either not
     configured or unusable, then let the user first configure the
     push-remote.

‘r u’ (‘magit-rebase-onto-upstream’)
     This command rebases the current branch onto its upstream branch.

     With a prefix argument or when the upstream is either not
     configured or unusable, then let the user first configure the
     upstream.

‘r e’ (‘magit-rebase-branch’)
     This command rebases the current branch onto a branch read in the
     minibuffer.  All commits that are reachable from head but not from
     the selected branch TARGET are being rebased.

‘r s’ (‘magit-rebase-subset’)
     This command starts a non-interactive rebase sequence to transfer
     commits from START to ‘HEAD’ onto NEWBASE.  START has to be
     selected from a list of recent commits.

   By default Magit uses the ‘--autostash’ argument, which causes
uncommitted changes to be stored in a stash before the rebase begins.
These changes are restored after the rebase completes and if possible
the stash is removed.  If the stash does not apply cleanly, then the
stash is not removed.  In case something goes wrong when resolving the
conflicts, this allows you to start over.

   Even though one of the actions is dedicated to interactive rebases,
the transient also features the infix argument ‘--interactive’.  This
can be used to turn one of the other, non-interactive rebase variants
into an interactive rebase.

   For example if you want to clean up a feature branch and at the same
time rebase it onto ‘master’, then you could use ‘r-iu’.  But we
recommend that you instead do that in two steps.  First use ‘ri’ to
cleanup the feature branch, and then in a second step ‘ru’ to rebase it
onto ‘master’.  That way if things turn out to be more complicated than
you thought and/or you make a mistake and have to start over, then you
only have to redo half the work.

   Explicitly enabling ‘--interactive’ won’t have an effect on the
following commands as they always use that argument anyway, even if it
is not enabled in the transient.

‘r i’ (‘magit-rebase-interactive’)
     This command starts an interactive rebase sequence.

‘r f’ (‘magit-rebase-autosquash’)
     This command combines squash and fixup commits with their intended
     targets.

‘r m’ (‘magit-rebase-edit-commit’)
     This command starts an interactive rebase sequence that lets the
     user edit a single older commit.

‘r w’ (‘magit-rebase-reword-commit’)
     This command starts an interactive rebase sequence that lets the
     user reword a single older commit.

‘r k’ (‘magit-rebase-remove-commit’)
     This command removes a single older commit using rebase.

   When a rebase is in progress, then the transient instead features the
following suffix commands.

‘r r’ (‘magit-rebase-continue’)
     This command restart the current rebasing operation.

     In some cases this pops up a commit message buffer for you do edit.
     With a prefix argument the old message is reused as-is.

‘r s’ (‘magit-rebase-skip’)
     This command skips the current commit and restarts the current
     rebase operation.

‘r e’ (‘magit-rebase-edit’)
     This command lets the user edit the todo list of the current rebase
     operation.

‘r a’ (‘magit-rebase-abort’)
     This command aborts the current rebase operation, restoring the
     original branch.

6.9.1 Editing Rebase Sequences
------------------------------

‘C-c C-c’ (‘with-editor-finish’)
     Finish the current editing session by returning with exit code 0.
     Git then uses the rebase instructions it finds in the file.

‘C-c C-k’ (‘with-editor-cancel’)
     Cancel the current editing session by returning with exit code 1.
     Git then forgoes starting the rebase sequence.

‘<RET>’ (‘git-rebase-show-commit’)
     Show the commit on the current line in another buffer and select
     that buffer.

‘<SPC>’ (‘git-rebase-show-or-scroll-up’)
     Show the commit on the current line in another buffer without
     selecting that buffer.  If the revision buffer is already visible
     in another window of the current frame, then instead scroll that
     window up.

‘<DEL>’ (‘git-rebase-show-or-scroll-down’)
     Show the commit on the current line in another buffer without
     selecting that buffer.  If the revision buffer is already visible
     in another window of the current frame, then instead scroll that
     window down.

‘p’ (‘git-rebase-backward-line’)
     Move to previous line.

‘n’ (‘forward-line’)
     Move to next line.

‘M-p’ (‘git-rebase-move-line-up’)
     Move the current commit (or command) up.

‘M-n’ (‘git-rebase-move-line-down’)
     Move the current commit (or command) down.

‘r’ (‘git-rebase-reword’)
     Edit message of commit on current line.

‘e’ (‘git-rebase-edit’)
     Stop at the commit on the current line.

‘s’ (‘git-rebase-squash’)
     Meld commit on current line into previous commit, and edit message.

‘f’ (‘git-rebase-fixup’)
     Meld commit on current line into previous commit, discarding the
     current commit’s message.

‘k’ (‘git-rebase-kill-line’)
     Kill the current action line.

‘c’ (‘git-rebase-pick’)
     Use commit on current line.

‘x’ (‘git-rebase-exec’)
     Insert a shell command to be run after the proceeding commit.

     If there already is such a command on the current line, then edit
     that instead.  With a prefix argument insert a new command even
     when there already is one on the current line.  With empty input
     remove the command on the current line, if any.

‘b’ (‘git-rebase-break’)
     Insert a break action before the current line, instructing Git to
     return control to the user.

‘y’ (‘git-rebase-insert’)
     Read an arbitrary commit and insert it below current line.

‘C-x u’ (‘git-rebase-undo’)
     Undo some previous changes.  Like ‘undo’ but works in read-only
     buffers.

 -- User Option: git-rebase-auto-advance
     Whether to move to next line after changing a line.

 -- User Option: git-rebase-show-instructions
     Whether to show usage instructions inside the rebase buffer.

 -- User Option: git-rebase-confirm-cancel
     Whether confirmation is required to cancel.

   When a rebase is performed with the ‘--rebase-merges’ option, the
sequence will include a few other types of actions and the following
commands become relevant.

‘l’ (‘git-rebase-label’)
     This commands inserts a label action or edits the one at point.

‘t’ (‘git-rebase-reset’)
     This command inserts a reset action or edits the one at point.  The
     prompt will offer the labels that are currently present in the
     buffer.

‘MM’ (‘git-rebase-merge’)
     The command inserts a merge action or edits the one at point.  The
     prompt will offer the labels that are currently present in the
     buffer.  Specifying a message to reuse via ‘-c’ or ‘-C’ is not
     supported; an editor will always be invoked for the merge.

‘Mt’ (‘git-rebase-merge-toggle-editmsg’)
     This command toggles between the ‘-C’ and ‘-c’ options of the merge
     action at point.  These options both specify a commit whose message
     should be reused.  The lower-case variant instructs Git to invoke
     the editor when creating the merge, allowing the user to edit the
     message.

6.9.2 Information About In-Progress Rebase
------------------------------------------

While a rebase sequence is in progress, the status buffer features a
section that lists the commits that have already been applied as well as
the commits that still have to be applied.

   The commits are split in two halves.  When rebase stops at a commit,
either because the user has to deal with a conflict or because s/he
explicitly requested that rebase stops at that commit, then point is
placed on the commit that separates the two groups, i.e., on ‘HEAD’.
The commits above it have not been applied yet, while the ‘HEAD’ and the
commits below it have already been applied.  In between these two groups
of applied and yet-to-be applied commits, there sometimes is a commit
which has been dropped.

   Each commit is prefixed with a word and these words are additionally
shown in different colors to indicate the status of the commits.

   The following colors are used:

   • Commits that use the same foreground color as the ‘default’ face
     have not been applied yet.

   • Yellow commits have some special relationship to the commit rebase
     stopped at.  This is used for the words "join", "goal", "same" and
     "work" (see below).

   • Gray commits have already been applied.

   • The blue commit is the ‘HEAD’ commit.

   • The green commit is the commit the rebase sequence stopped at.  If
     this is the same commit as ‘HEAD’ (e.g., because you haven’t done
     anything yet after rebase stopped at the commit, then this commit
     is shown in blue, not green).  There can only be a green *and* a
     blue commit at the same time, if you create one or more new commits
     after rebase stops at a commit.

   • Red commits have been dropped.  They are shown for reference only,
     e.g., to make it easier to diff.

   Of course these colors are subject to the color-theme in use.

   The following words are used:

   • Commits prefixed with ‘pick’, ‘reword’, ‘edit’, ‘squash’, and
     ‘fixup’ have not been applied yet.  These words have the same
     meaning here as they do in the buffer used to edit the rebase
     sequence.  See *note Editing Rebase Sequences::.  When the
     ‘--rebase-merges’ option was specified, ‘reset’, ‘label’, and
     ‘merge’ lines may also be present.

   • Commits prefixed with ‘done’ and ‘onto’ have already been applied.
     It is possible for such a commit to be the ‘HEAD’, in which case it
     is blue.  Otherwise it is grey.

        • The commit prefixed with ‘onto’ is the commit on top of which
          all the other commits are being re-applied.  This commit
          itself did not have to be re-applied, it is the commit rebase
          did rewind to before starting to re-apply other commits.

        • Commits prefixed with ‘done’ have already been re-applied.
          This includes commits that have been re-applied but also new
          commits that you have created during the rebase.

   • All other commits, those not prefixed with any of the above words,
     are in some way related to the commit at which rebase stopped.

     To determine whether a commit is related to the stopped-at commit
     their hashes, trees and patch-ids (1) are being compared.  The
     commit message is not used for this purpose.

     Generally speaking commits that are related to the stopped-at
     commit can have any of the used colors, though not all color/word
     combinations are possible.

     Words used for stopped-at commits are:

        • When a commit is prefixed with ‘void’, then that indicates
          that Magit knows for sure that all the changes in that commit
          have been applied using several new commits.  This commit is
          no longer reachable from ‘HEAD’, and it also isn’t one of the
          commits that will be applied when resuming the session.

        • When a commit is prefixed with ‘join’, then that indicates
          that the rebase sequence stopped at that commit due to a
          conflict - you now have to join (merge) the changes with what
          has already been applied.  In a sense this is the commit
          rebase stopped at, but while its effect is already in the
          index and in the worktree (with conflict markers), the commit
          itself has not actually been applied yet (it isn’t the
          ‘HEAD’).  So it is shown in yellow, like the other commits
          that still have to be applied.

        • When a commit is prefixed with ‘stop’ or a _blue_ or _green_
          ‘same’, then that indicates that rebase stopped at this
          commit, that it is still applied or has been applied again,
          and that at least its patch-id is unchanged.

             • When a commit is prefixed with ‘stop’, then that
               indicates that rebase stopped at that commit because you
               requested that earlier, and its patch-id is unchanged.
               It might even still be the exact same commit.

             • When a commit is prefixed with a _blue_ or _green_
               ‘same’, then that indicates that while its tree or hash
               changed, its patch-id did not.  If it is blue, then it is
               the ‘HEAD’ commit (as always for blue).  When it is
               green, then it no longer is ‘HEAD’ because other commit
               have been created since (but before continuing the
               rebase).

        • When a commit is prefixed with ‘goal’, a _yellow_ ‘same,’ or
          ‘work’, then that indicates that rebase applied that commit
          but that you then reset ‘HEAD’ to an earlier commit (likely to
          split it up into multiple commits), and that there are some
          uncommitted changes remaining which likely (but not
          necessarily) originate from that commit.

             • When a commit is prefixed with ‘goal’, then that
               indicates that it is still possible to create a new
               commit with the exact same tree (the "goal") without
               manually editing any files, by committing the index, or
               by staging all changes and then committing that.  This is
               the case when the original tree still exists in the index
               or worktree in untainted form.

             • When a commit is prefixed with a yellow ‘same’, then that
               indicates that it is no longer possible to create a
               commit with the exact same tree, but that it is still
               possible to create a commit with the same patch-id.  This
               would be the case if you created a new commit with other
               changes, but the changes from the original commit still
               exist in the index or working tree in untainted form.

             • When a commit is prefixed with ‘work’, then that
               indicates that you reset ‘HEAD’ to an earlier commit, and
               that there are some staged and/or unstaged changes
               (likely, but not necessarily) originating from that
               commit.  However it is no longer possible to create a new
               commit with the same tree or at least the same patch-id
               because you have already made other changes.

        • When a commit is prefixed with ‘poof’ or ‘gone’, then that
          indicates that rebase applied that commit but that you then
          reset ‘HEAD’ to an earlier commit (likely to split it up into
          multiple commits), and that there are no uncommitted changes.

             • When a commit is prefixed with ‘poof’, then that
               indicates that it is no longer reachable from ‘HEAD’, but
               that it has been replaced with one or more commits, which
               together have the exact same effect.

             • When a commit is prefixed with ‘gone’, then that
               indicates that it is no longer reachable from ‘HEAD’ and
               that we also cannot determine whether its changes are
               still in effect in one or more new commits.  They might
               be, but if so, then there must also be other changes
               which makes it impossible to know for sure.

   Do not worry if you do not fully understand the above.  That’s okay,
you will acquire a good enough understanding through practice.

   For other sequence operations such as cherry-picking, a similar
section is displayed, but they lack some of the features described
above, due to limitations in the git commands used to implement them.
Most importantly these sequences only support "picking" a commit but not
other actions such as "rewording", and they do not keep track of the
commits which have already been applied.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The patch-id is a hash of the _changes_ introduced by a commit.
It differs from the hash of the commit itself, which is a hash of the
result of applying that change (i.e., the resulting trees and blobs) as
well as author and committer information, the commit message, and the
hashes of the parents of the commit.  The patch-id hash on the other
hand is created only from the added and removed lines, even line numbers
and whitespace changes are ignored when calculating this hash.  The
patch-ids of two commits can be used to answer the question "Do these
commits make the same change?".

6.10 Cherry Picking
===================

Also see *note (gitman)git-cherry-pick::.

‘A’ (‘magit-cherry-pick’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

   When no cherry-pick or revert is in progress, then the transient
features the following suffix commands.

‘A A’ (‘magit-cherry-copy’)
     This command copies COMMITS from another branch onto the current
     branch.  If the region selects multiple commits, then those are
     copied, without prompting.  Otherwise the user is prompted for a
     commit or range, defaulting to the commit at point.

‘A a’ (‘magit-cherry-apply’)
     This command applies the changes in COMMITS from another branch
     onto the current branch.  If the region selects multiple commits,
     then those are used, without prompting.  Otherwise the user is
     prompted for a commit or range, defaulting to the commit at point.

     This command also has a top-level binding, which can be invoked
     without using the transient by typing ‘a’ at the top-level.

   The following commands not only apply some commits to some branch,
but also remove them from some other branch.  The removal is performed
using either ‘git-update-ref’ or if necessary ‘git-rebase’.  Both
applying commits as well as removing them using ‘git-rebase’ can lead to
conflicts.  If that happens, then these commands abort and you not only
have to resolve the conflicts but also finish the process the same way
you would have to if these commands didn’t exist at all.

‘A h’ (‘magit-cherry-harvest’)
     This command moves the selected COMMITS that must be located on
     another BRANCH onto the current branch instead, removing them from
     the former.  When this command succeeds, then the same branch is
     current as before.

     Applying the commits on the current branch or removing them from
     the other branch can lead to conflicts.  When that happens, then
     this command stops and you have to resolve the conflicts and then
     finish the process manually.

‘A d’ (‘magit-cherry-donate’)
     This command moves the selected COMMITS from the current branch
     onto another existing BRANCH, removing them from the former.  When
     this command succeeds, then the same branch is current as before.
     ‘HEAD’ is allowed to be detached initially.

     Applying the commits on the other branch or removing them from the
     current branch can lead to conflicts.  When that happens, then this
     command stops and you have to resolve the conflicts and then finish
     the process manually.

‘A n’ (‘magit-cherry-spinout’)
     This command moves the selected COMMITS from the current branch
     onto a new branch BRANCH, removing them from the former.  When this
     command succeeds, then the same branch is current as before.

     Applying the commits on the other branch or removing them from the
     current branch can lead to conflicts.  When that happens, then this
     command stops and you have to resolve the conflicts and then finish
     the process manually.

‘A s’ (‘magit-cherry-spinoff’)
     This command moves the selected COMMITS from the current branch
     onto a new branch BRANCH, removing them from the former.  When this
     command succeeds, then the new branch is checked out.

     Applying the commits on the other branch or removing them from the
     current branch can lead to conflicts.  When that happens, then this
     command stops and you have to resolve the conflicts and then finish
     the process manually.

   When a cherry-pick or revert is in progress, then the transient
instead features the following suffix commands.

‘A A’ (‘magit-sequence-continue’)
     Resume the current cherry-pick or revert sequence.

‘A s’ (‘magit-sequence-skip’)
     Skip the stopped at commit during a cherry-pick or revert sequence.

‘A a’ (‘magit-sequence-abort’)
     Abort the current cherry-pick or revert sequence.  This discards
     all changes made since the sequence started.

File: magit.info,  Node: Reverting,  Up: Cherry Picking

6.10.1 Reverting
----------------

‘V’ (‘magit-revert’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

   When no cherry-pick or revert is in progress, then the transient
features the following suffix commands.

‘V V’ (‘magit-revert-and-commit’)
     Revert a commit by creating a new commit.  Prompt for a commit,
     defaulting to the commit at point.  If the region selects multiple
     commits, then revert all of them, without prompting.

‘V v’ (‘magit-revert-no-commit’)
     Revert a commit by applying it in reverse to the working tree.
     Prompt for a commit, defaulting to the commit at point.  If the
     region selects multiple commits, then revert all of them, without
     prompting.

   When a cherry-pick or revert is in progress, then the transient
instead features the following suffix commands.

‘V V’ (‘magit-sequence-continue’)
     Resume the current cherry-pick or revert sequence.

‘V s’ (‘magit-sequence-skip’)
     Skip the stopped at commit during a cherry-pick or revert sequence.

‘V a’ (‘magit-sequence-abort’)
     Abort the current cherry-pick or revert sequence.  This discards
     all changes made since the sequence started.

6.11 Resetting
==============

Also see *note (gitman)git-reset::.

‘x’ (‘magit-reset-quickly’)
     Reset the ‘HEAD’ and index to some commit read from the user and
     defaulting to the commit at point, and possibly also reset the
     working tree.  With a prefix argument reset the working tree
     otherwise don’t.

‘X m’ (‘magit-reset-mixed’)
     Reset the ‘HEAD’ and index to some commit read from the user and
     defaulting to the commit at point.  The working tree is kept as-is.

‘X s’ (‘magit-reset-soft’)
     Reset the ‘HEAD’ to some commit read from the user and defaulting
     to the commit at point.  The index and the working tree are kept
     as-is.

‘X h’ (‘magit-reset-hard’)
     Reset the ‘HEAD’, index, and working tree to some commit read from
     the user and defaulting to the commit at point.

‘X k’ (‘magit-reset-keep’)
     Reset the ‘HEAD’, index, and working tree to some commit read from
     the user and defaulting to the commit at point.  Uncommitted
     changes are kept as-is.

‘X i’ (‘magit-reset-index’)
     Reset the index to some commit read from the user and defaulting to
     the commit at point.  Keep the ‘HEAD’ and working tree as-is, so if
     the commit refers to the ‘HEAD’, then this effectively unstages all
     changes.

‘X w’ (‘magit-reset-worktree’)
     Reset the working tree to some commit read from the user and
     defaulting to the commit at point.  Keep the ‘HEAD’ and index
     as-is.

‘X f’ (‘magit-file-checkout’)
     Update file in the working tree and index to the contents from a
     revision.  Both the revision and file are read from the user.

6.12 Stashing
=============

Also see *note (gitman)git-stash::.

‘z’ (‘magit-stash’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

‘z z’ (‘magit-stash-both’)
     Create a stash of the index and working tree.  Untracked files are
     included according to infix arguments.  One prefix argument is
     equivalent to ‘--include-untracked’ while two prefix arguments are
     equivalent to ‘--all’.

‘z i’ (‘magit-stash-index’)
     Create a stash of the index only.  Unstaged and untracked changes
     are not stashed.

‘z w’ (‘magit-stash-worktree’)
     Create a stash of unstaged changes in the working tree.  Untracked
     files are included according to infix arguments.  One prefix
     argument is equivalent to ‘--include-untracked’ while two prefix
     arguments are equivalent to ‘--all’.

‘z x’ (‘magit-stash-keep-index’)
     Create a stash of the index and working tree, keeping index intact.
     Untracked files are included according to infix arguments.  One
     prefix argument is equivalent to ‘--include-untracked’ while two
     prefix arguments are equivalent to ‘--all’.

‘z Z’ (‘magit-snapshot-both’)
     Create a snapshot of the index and working tree.  Untracked files
     are included according to infix arguments.  One prefix argument is
     equivalent to ‘--include-untracked’ while two prefix arguments are
     equivalent to ‘--all’.

‘z I’ (‘magit-snapshot-index’)
     Create a snapshot of the index only.  Unstaged and untracked
     changes are not stashed.

‘z W’ (‘magit-snapshot-worktree’)
     Create a snapshot of unstaged changes in the working tree.
     Untracked files are included according to infix arguments.  One
     prefix argument is equivalent to ‘--include-untracked’ while two
     prefix arguments are equivalent to ‘--all’-.

‘z a’ (‘magit-stash-apply’)
     Apply a stash to the working tree.

     First try ‘git stash apply --index’, which tries to preserve the
     index stored in the stash, if any.  This may fail because applying
     the stash could result in conflicts and those have to be stored in
     the index, making it impossible to also store the stash’s index
     there as well.

     If the above failed, then try ‘git stash apply’.  This fails (with
     or without ‘--index’) if there are any uncommitted changes to files
     that are also modified in the stash.

     If both of the above failed, then apply using ‘git apply’.  If
     there are no conflicting files, use ‘--3way’.  If there are
     conflicting files, then using ‘--3way’ requires that those files
     are staged first, which may be undesirable, so prompt the user
     whether to use ‘--3way’ or ‘--reject’.

     Customize ‘magit-no-confirm’ if you want to always use ‘--3way’,
     without being prompted.

‘z p’ (‘magit-stash-pop’)
     Apply a stash to the working tree.  On complete success (if the
     stash can be applied without any conflicts, and while preserving
     the stash’s index) then remove the stash from stash list.

     First try ‘git stash pop --index’, which tries to preserve the
     index stored in the stash, if any.  This may fail because applying
     the stash could result in conflicts and those have to be stored in
     the index, making it impossible to also store the stash’s index
     there as well.

     If the above failed, then try ‘git stash apply’.  This fails (with
     or without ‘--index’) if there are any uncommitted changes to files
     that are also modified in the stash.

     If both of the above failed, then apply using ‘git apply’.  If
     there are no conflicting files, use ‘--3way’.  If there are
     conflicting files, then using ‘--3way’ requires that those files
     are staged first, which may be undesirable, so prompt the user
     whether to use ‘--3way’ or ‘--reject’.

     Customize ‘magit-no-confirm’ if you want to always use ‘--3way’,
     without being prompted.

‘z k’ (‘magit-stash-drop’)
     Remove a stash from the stash list.  When the region is active,
     offer to drop all contained stashes.

‘z v’ (‘magit-stash-show’)
     Show all diffs of a stash in a buffer.

‘z b’ (‘magit-stash-branch’)
     Create and checkout a new branch from an existing stash.  The new
     branch starts at the commit that was current when the stash was
     created.

‘z B’ (‘magit-stash-branch-here’)
     Create and checkout a new branch from an existing stash.  Use the
     current branch or ‘HEAD’ as the starting-point of the new branch.
     Then apply the stash, dropping it if it applies cleanly.

‘z f’ (‘magit-stash-format-patch’)
     Create a patch from STASH.

‘k’ (‘magit-stash-clear’)
     Remove all stashes saved in REF’s reflog by deleting REF.

‘z l’ (‘magit-stash-list’)
     List all stashes in a buffer.

 -- User Option: magit-stashes-margin
     This option specifies whether the margin is initially shown in
     stashes buffers and how it is formatted.

     The value has the form ‘(INIT STYLE WIDTH AUTHOR AUTHOR-WIDTH)’.

        • If INIT is non-nil, then the margin is shown initially.
        • STYLE controls how to format the author or committer date.  It
          can be one of ‘age’ (to show the age of the commit),
          ‘age-abbreviated’ (to abbreviate the time unit to a
          character), or a string (suitable for ‘format-time-string’) to
          show the actual date.  Option
          ‘magit-log-margin-show-committer-date’ controls which date is
          being displayed.
        • WIDTH controls the width of the margin.  This exists for
          forward compatibility and currently the value should not be
          changed.
        • AUTHOR controls whether the name of the author is also shown
          by default.
        • AUTHOR-WIDTH has to be an integer.  When the name of the
          author is shown, then this specifies how much space is used to
          do so.

File: magit.info,  Node: Remote Commands,  Next: Remote Git Variables,  Up: Remotes

7.1.1 Remote Commands
---------------------

The transient prefix command ‘magit-remote’ is used to add remotes and
to make changes to existing remotes.  This command only deals with
remotes themselves, not with branches or the transfer of commits.  Those
features are available from separate transient commands.

   Also see *note (gitman)git-remote::.

‘M’ (‘magit-remote’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     and displays them in a temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

     By default it also binds and displays the values of some
     remote-related Git variables and allows changing their values.

 -- User Option: magit-remote-direct-configure
     This option controls whether remote-related Git variables are
     accessible directly from the transient ‘magit-remote’.

     If ‘t’ (the default) and a local branch is checked out, then
     ‘magit-remote’ features the variables for the upstream remote of
     that branch, or if ‘HEAD’ is detached, for ‘origin’, provided that
     exists.

     If ‘nil’, then ‘magit-remote-configure’ has to be used to do so.

‘M C’ (‘magit-remote-configure’)
     This transient prefix command binds commands that set the value of
     remote-related variables and displays them in a temporary buffer
     until the transient is exited.

     With a prefix argument, this command always prompts for a remote.

     Without a prefix argument this depends on whether it was invoked as
     a suffix of ‘magit-remote’ and on the
     ‘magit-remote-direct-configure’ option.  If ‘magit-remote’ already
     displays the variables for the upstream, then it does not make
     sense to invoke another transient that displays them for the same
     remote.  In that case this command prompts for a remote.

   The variables are described in *note Remote Git Variables::.

‘M a’ (‘magit-remote-add’)
     This command add a remote and fetches it.  The remote name and url
     are read in the minibuffer.

‘M r’ (‘magit-remote-rename’)
     This command renames a remote.  Both the old and the new names are
     read in the minibuffer.

‘M u’ (‘magit-remote-set-url’)
     This command changes the url of a remote.  Both the remote and the
     new url are read in the minibuffer.

‘M k’ (‘magit-remote-remove’)
     This command deletes a remote, read in the minibuffer.

‘M p’ (‘magit-remote-prune’)
     This command removes stale remote-tracking branches for a remote
     read in the minibuffer.

‘M P’ (‘magit-remote-prune-refspecs’)
     This command removes stale refspecs for a remote read in the
     minibuffer.

     A refspec is stale if there no longer exists at least one branch on
     the remote that would be fetched due to that refspec.  A stale
     refspec is problematic because its existence causes Git to refuse
     to fetch according to the remaining non-stale refspecs.

     If only stale refspecs remain, then this command offers to either
     delete the remote or to replace the stale refspecs with the default
     refspec ("+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/REMOTE/*").

     This command also removes the remote-tracking branches that were
     created due to the now stale refspecs.  Other stale branches are
     not removed.

 -- User Option: magit-remote-add-set-remote.pushDefault
     This option controls whether the user is asked whether they want to
     set ‘remote.pushDefault’ after adding a remote.

     If ‘ask’, then users is always ask.  If ‘ask-if-unset’, then the
     user is only if the variable isn’t set already.  If ‘nil’, then the
     user isn’t asked and the variable isn’t set.  If the value is a
     string, then the variable is set without the user being asked,
     provided that the name of the added remote is equal to that string
     and the variable isn’t already set.

7.1.2 Remote Git Variables
--------------------------

These variables can be set from the transient prefix command
‘magit-remote-configure’.  By default they can also be set from
‘magit-remote’.  See *note Remote Commands::.

 -- Variable: remote.NAME.url
     This variable specifies the url of the remote named NAME.  It can
     have multiple values.

 -- Variable: remote.NAME.fetch
     The refspec used when fetching from the remote named NAME.  It can
     have multiple values.

 -- Variable: remote.NAME.pushurl
     This variable specifies the url used for pushing to the remote
     named NAME.  If it is not specified, then ‘remote.NAME.url’ is used
     instead.  It can have multiple values.

 -- Variable: remote.NAME.push
     The refspec used when pushing to the remote named NAME.  It can
     have multiple values.

 -- Variable: remote.NAME.tagOpts
     This variable specifies what tags are fetched by default.  If the
     value is ‘--no-tags’ then no tags are fetched.  If the value is
     ‘--tags’, then all tags are fetched.  If this variable has no
     value, then only tags are fetched that are reachable from fetched
     branches.

7.2 Fetching
============

Also see *note (gitman)git-fetch::.  For information about the upstream
and the push-remote, see *note The Two Remotes::.

‘f’ (‘magit-fetch’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

‘f p’ (‘magit-fetch-from-pushremote’)
     This command fetches from the current push-remote.

     With a prefix argument or when the push-remote is either not
     configured or unusable, then let the user first configure the
     push-remote.

‘f u’ (‘magit-fetch-from-upstream’)
     This command fetch from the upstream of the current branch.

     If the upstream is configured for the current branch and names an
     existing remote, then use that.  Otherwise try to use another
     remote: If only a single remote is configured, then use that.
     Otherwise if a remote named "origin" exists, then use that.

     If no remote can be determined, then this command is not available
     from the ‘magit-fetch’ transient prefix and invoking it directly
     results in an error.

‘f e’ (‘magit-fetch-other’)
     This command fetch from a repository read from the minibuffer.

‘f o’ (‘magit-fetch-branch’)
     This command fetches a branch from a remote, both of which are read
     from the minibuffer.

‘f r’ (‘magit-fetch-refspec’)
     This command fetches from a remote using an explicit refspec, both
     of which are read from the minibuffer.

‘f a’ (‘magit-fetch-all’)
     This command fetches from all remotes.

‘f m’ (‘magit-submodule-fetch’)
     This command fetches all submodules.  With a prefix argument it
     fetches all remotes of all submodules.

 -- User Option: magit-pull-or-fetch
     By default fetch and pull commands are available from separate
     transient prefix command.  Setting this to ‘t’ adds some (but not
     all) of the above suffix commands to the ‘magit-pull’ transient.

     If you do that, then you might also want to change the key binding
     for these prefix commands, e.g.:

          (setq magit-pull-or-fetch t)
          (define-key magit-mode-map "f" 'magit-pull) ; was magit-fetch
          (define-key magit-mode-map "F" nil)         ; was magit-pull

Also see *note (gitman)git-pull::.  For information about the upstream
and the push-remote, see *note The Two Remotes::.

‘F’ (‘magit-pull’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     and displays them in a temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

‘F p’ (‘magit-pull-from-pushremote’)
     This command pulls from the push-remote of the current branch.

     With a prefix argument or when the push-remote is either not
     configured or unusable, then let the user first configure the
     push-remote.

‘F u’ (‘magit-pull-from-upstream’)
     This command pulls from the upstream of the current branch.

     With a prefix argument or when the upstream is either not
     configured or unusable, then let the user first configure the
     upstream.

‘F e’ (‘magit-pull-branch’)
     This command pulls from a branch read in the minibuffer.

7.4 Pushing
===========

Also see *note (gitman)git-push::.  For information about the upstream
and the push-remote, see *note The Two Remotes::.

‘P’ (‘magit-push’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

‘P p’ (‘magit-push-current-to-pushremote’)
     This command pushes the current branch to its push-remote.

     With a prefix argument or when the push-remote is either not
     configured or unusable, then let the user first configure the
     push-remote.

‘P u’ (‘magit-push-current-to-upstream’)
     This command pushes the current branch to its upstream branch.

     With a prefix argument or when the upstream is either not
     configured or unusable, then let the user first configure the
     upstream.

‘P e’ (‘magit-push-current’)
     This command pushes the current branch to a branch read in the
     minibuffer.

‘P o’ (‘magit-push-other’)
     This command pushes an arbitrary branch or commit somewhere.  Both
     the source and the target are read in the minibuffer.

‘P r’ (‘magit-push-refspecs’)
     This command pushes one or multiple refspecs to a remote, both of
     which are read in the minibuffer.

     To use multiple refspecs, separate them with commas.  Completion is
     only available for the part before the colon, or when no colon is
     used.

‘P m’ (‘magit-push-matching’)
     This command pushes all matching branches to another repository.

     If only one remote exists, then push to that.  Otherwise prompt for
     a remote, offering the remote configured for the current branch as
     default.

‘P t’ (‘magit-push-tags’)
     This command pushes all tags to another repository.

     If only one remote exists, then push to that.  Otherwise prompt for
     a remote, offering the remote configured for the current branch as
     default.

‘P T’ (‘magit-push-tag’)
     This command pushes a tag to another repository.

   One of the infix arguments, ‘--force-with-lease’, deserves a word of
caution.  It is passed without a value, which means "permit a force push
as long as the remote-tracking branches match their counterparts on the
remote end".  If you’ve set up a tool to do automatic fetches (Magit
itself does not provide such functionality), using ‘--force-with-lease’
can be dangerous because you don’t actually control or know the state of
the remote-tracking refs.  In that case, you should consider setting
‘push.useForceIfIncludes’ to ‘true’ (available since Git 2.30).

   Two more push commands exist, which by default are not available from
the push transient.  See their doc-strings for instructions on how to
add them to the transient.

 -- Command: magit-push-implicitly args
     This command pushes somewhere without using an explicit refspec.

     This command simply runs ‘git push -v [ARGS]’.  ARGS are the infix
     arguments.  No explicit refspec arguments are used.  Instead the
     behavior depends on at least these Git variables: ‘push.default’,
     ‘remote.pushDefault’, ‘branch.<branch>.pushRemote’,
     ‘branch.<branch>.remote’, ‘branch.<branch>.merge’, and
     ‘remote.<remote>.push’.

     If you add this suffix to a transient prefix without explicitly
     specifying the description, then an attempt is made to predict what
     this command will do.  For example:

          (transient-insert-suffix 'magit-push \"p\"
            '(\"i\" magit-push-implicitly))"

 -- Command: magit-push-to-remote remote args
     This command pushes to the remote REMOTE without using an explicit
     refspec.  The remote is read in the minibuffer.

     This command simply runs ‘git push -v [ARGS] REMOTE’.  ARGS are the
     infix arguments.  No refspec arguments are used.  Instead the
     behavior depends on at least these Git variables: ‘push.default’,
     ‘remote.pushDefault’, ‘branch.<branch>.pushRemote’,
     ‘branch.<branch>.remote’, ‘branch.<branch>.merge’, and
     ‘remote.<remote>.push’.

7.5 Plain Patches
=================

‘W’ (‘magit-patch’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

‘W c’ (‘magit-patch-create’)
     This command creates patches for a set commits.  If the region
     marks several commits, then it creates patches for all of them.
     Otherwise it functions as a transient prefix command, which
     features several infix arguments and binds itself as a suffix
     command.  When this command is invoked as a suffix of itself, then
     it creates a patch using the specified infix arguments.

‘w a’ (‘magit-patch-apply’)
     This command applies a patch.  This is a transient prefix command,
     which features several infix arguments and binds itself as a suffix
     command.  When this command is invoked as a suffix of itself, then
     it applies a patch using the specified infix arguments.

‘W s’ (‘magit-patch-save’)
     This command creates a patch from the current diff.

     Inside ‘magit-diff-mode’ or ‘magit-revision-mode’ buffers, ‘C-x
     C-w’ is also bound to this command.

   It is also possible to save a plain patch file by using ‘C-x C-w’
inside a ‘magit-diff-mode’ or ‘magit-revision-mode’ buffer.

7.6 Maildir Patches
===================

Also see *note (gitman)git-am::.  and *note (gitman)git-apply::.

‘w’ (‘magit-am’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

‘w w’ (‘magit-am-apply-patches’)
     This command applies one or more patches.  If the region marks
     files, then those are applied as patches.  Otherwise this command
     reads a file-name in the minibuffer, defaulting to the file at
     point.

‘w m’ (‘magit-am-apply-maildir’)
     This command applies patches from a maildir.

‘w a’ (‘magit-patch-apply’)
     This command applies a plain patch.  For a longer description see
     *note Plain Patches::.  This command is only available from the
     ‘magit-am’ transient for historic reasons.

   When an "am" operation is in progress, then the transient instead
features the following suffix commands.

‘w w’ (‘magit-am-continue’)
     This command resumes the current patch applying sequence.

‘w s’ (‘magit-am-skip’)
     This command skips the stopped at patch during a patch applying
     sequence.

‘w a’ (‘magit-am-abort’)
     This command aborts the current patch applying sequence.  This
     discards all changes made since the sequence started.

8.1 Tagging
===========

Also see *note (gitman)git-tag::.

‘t’ (‘magit-tag’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

‘t t’ (‘magit-tag-create’)
     This command creates a new tag with the given NAME at REV.  With a
     prefix argument it creates an annotated tag.

‘t r’ (‘magit-tag-release’)
     This commands creates a release tag.  It assumes that release tags
     match ‘magit-release-tag-regexp’.

     First it prompts for the name of the new tag using the highest
     existing tag as initial input and leaving it to the user to
     increment the desired part of the version string.  If you use
     unconventional release tags or version numbers (e.g.,
     ‘v1.2.3-custom.1’), you can set the ‘magit-release-tag-regexp’ and
     ‘magit-tag-version-regexp-alist’ variables.

     If ‘--annotate’ is enabled then it prompts for the message of the
     new tag.  The proposed tag message is based on the message of the
     highest tag, provided that that contains the corresponding version
     string and substituting the new version string for that.  Otherwise
     it proposes something like "Foo-Bar 1.2.3", given, for example, a
     TAG "v1.2.3" and a repository located at something like
     "/path/to/foo-bar".

‘t k’ (‘magit-tag-delete’)
     This command deletes one or more tags.  If the region marks
     multiple tags (and nothing else), then it offers to delete those.
     Otherwise, it prompts for a single tag to be deleted, defaulting to
     the tag at point.

‘t p’ (‘magit-tag-prune’)
     This command offers to delete tags missing locally from REMOTE, and
     vice versa.

8.2 Notes
=========

Also see *note (gitman)git-notes::.

‘T’ (‘magit-notes’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

‘T T’ (‘magit-notes-edit’)
     Edit the note attached to a commit, defaulting to the commit at
     point.

     By default use the value of Git variable ‘core.notesRef’ or
     "refs/notes/commits" if that is undefined.

‘T r’ (‘magit-notes-remove’)
     Remove the note attached to a commit, defaulting to the commit at
     point.

     By default use the value of Git variable ‘core.notesRef’ or
     "refs/notes/commits" if that is undefined.

‘T p’ (‘magit-notes-prune’)
     Remove notes about unreachable commits.

   It is possible to merge one note ref into another.  That may result
in conflicts which have to resolved in the temporary worktree
".git/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE".

‘T m’ (‘magit-notes-merge’)
     Merge the notes of a ref read from the user into the current notes
     ref.  The current notes ref is the value of Git variable
     ‘core.notesRef’ or "refs/notes/commits" if that is undefined.

   When a notes merge is in progress then the transient features the
following suffix commands, instead of those listed above.

‘T c’ (‘magit-notes-merge-commit’)
     Commit the current notes ref merge, after manually resolving
     conflicts.

‘T a’ (‘magit-notes-merge-abort’)
     Abort the current notes ref merge.

   The following variables control what notes reference ‘magit-notes-*’,
‘git notes’ and ‘git show’ act on and display.  Both the local and
global values are displayed and can be modified.

 -- Variable: core.notesRef
     This variable specifies the notes ref that is displayed by default
     and which commands act on by default.

 -- Variable: notes.displayRef
     This variable specifies additional notes ref to be displayed in
     addition to the ref specified by ‘core.notesRef’.  It can have
     multiple values and may end with ‘*’ to display all refs in the
     ‘refs/notes/’ namespace (or ‘**’ if some names contain slashes).

8.3 Submodules
==============

* Listing Submodules::

File: magit.info,  Node: Listing Submodules,  Next: Submodule Transient,  Up: Submodules

8.3.1 Listing Submodules
------------------------

The command ‘magit-list-submodules’ displays a list of the current
repository’s submodules in a separate buffer.  It’s also possible to
display information about submodules directly in the status buffer of
the super-repository by adding ‘magit-insert-modules’ to the hook
‘magit-status-sections-hook’ as described in *note Status Module
Sections::.

 -- Command: magit-list-submodules
     This command displays a list of the current repository’s populated
     submodules in a separate buffer.

     It can be invoked by pressing ‘RET’ on the section titled
     "Modules".

 -- User Option: magit-submodule-list-columns
     This option controls what columns are displayed by the command
     ‘magit-list-submodules’ and how they are displayed.

     Each element has the form ‘(HEADER WIDTH FORMAT PROPS)’.

     HEADER is the string displayed in the header.  WIDTH is the width
     of the column.  FORMAT is a function that is called with one
     argument, the repository identification (usually its basename), and
     with ‘default-directory’ bound to the toplevel of its working tree.
     It has to return a string to be inserted or nil.  PROPS is an alist
     that supports the keys ‘:right-align’, ‘:pad-right’ and ‘:sort’.

     The ‘:sort’ function has a weird interface described in the
     docstring of ‘tabulated-list--get-sort’.  Alternatively ‘<’ and
     ‘magit-repolist-version<’ can be used as those functions are
     automatically replaced with functions that satisfy the interface.
     Set ‘:sort’ to ‘nil’ to inhibit sorting; if unspecified, then the
     column is sortable using the default sorter.

     You may wish to display a range of numeric columns using just one
     character per column and without any padding between columns, in
     which case you should use an appropriate HEADER, set WIDTH to 1,
     and set ‘:pad-right’ to 9.  ‘+’ is substituted for numbers higher
     than 9.


File: magit.info,  Node: Submodule Transient,  Prev: Listing Submodules,  Up: Submodules

8.3.2 Submodule Transient
-------------------------

‘o’ (‘magit-submodule’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

   Some of the below commands default to act on the modules that are
selected using the region.  For brevity their description talk about
"the selected modules", but if no modules are selected, then they act on
the current module instead, or if point isn’t on a module, then the read
a single module to act on.  With a prefix argument these commands ignore
the selection and the current module and instead act on all suitable
modules.

‘o a’ (‘magit-submodule-add’)
     This commands adds the repository at URL as a module.  Optional
     PATH is the path to the module relative to the root of the
     super-project.  If it is nil then the path is determined based on
     URL.

‘o r’ (‘magit-submodule-register’)
     This command registers the selected modules by copying their urls
     from ".gitmodules" to "$GIT_DIR/config".  These values can then be
     edited before running ‘magit-submodule-populate’.  If you don’t
     need to edit any urls, then use the latter directly.

‘o p’ (‘magit-submodule-populate’)
     This command creates the working directory or directories of the
     selected modules, checking out the recorded commits.

‘o u’ (‘magit-submodule-update’)
     This command updates the selected modules checking out the recorded
     commits.

‘o s’ (‘magit-submodule-synchronize’)
     This command synchronizes the urls of the selected modules, copying
     the values from ".gitmodules" to the ".git/config" of the
     super-project as well those of the modules.

‘o d’ (‘magit-submodule-unpopulate’)
     This command removes the working directory of the selected modules.

‘o l’ (‘magit-list-submodules’)
     This command displays a list of the current repository’s modules.

‘o f’ (‘magit-fetch-modules’)
     This command fetches all populated modules.

     Option ‘magit-fetch-modules-jobs’ controls how many submodules are
     being fetched in parallel.  Also fetch the super-repository,
     because ‘git fetch’ does not support not doing that.  With a prefix
     argument fetch all remotes.


File: magit.info,  Node: Subtree,  Next: Worktree,  Prev: Submodules,  Up: Miscellaneous

8.4 Subtree
===========

Also see *note (gitman)git-subtree::.

‘O’ (‘magit-subtree’)
     This transient prefix command binds the two sub-transients; one for
     importing a subtree and one for exporting a subtree.

‘O i’ (‘magit-subtree-import’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

     The suffixes of this command import subtrees.

     If the ‘--prefix’ argument is set, then the suffix commands use
     that prefix without prompting the user.  If it is unset, then they
     read the prefix in the minibuffer.

‘O i a’ (‘magit-subtree-add’)
     This command adds COMMIT from REPOSITORY as a new subtree at
     PREFIX.

‘O i c’ (‘magit-subtree-add-commit’)
     This command add COMMIT as a new subtree at PREFIX.

‘O i m’ (‘magit-subtree-merge’)
     This command merges COMMIT into the PREFIX subtree.

‘O i f’ (‘magit-subtree-pull’)
     This command pulls COMMIT from REPOSITORY into the PREFIX subtree.

‘O e’ (‘magit-subtree-export’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

     The suffixes of this command export subtrees.

     If the ‘--prefix’ argument is set, then the suffix commands use
     that prefix without prompting the user.  If it is unset, then they
     read the prefix in the minibuffer.

‘O e p’ (‘magit-subtree-push’)
     This command extract the history of the subtree PREFIX and pushes
     it to REF on REPOSITORY.

‘O e s’ (‘magit-subtree-split’)
     This command extracts the history of the subtree PREFIX.

8.5 Worktree
============

Also see *note (gitman)git-worktree::.

‘Z’ (‘magit-worktree’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     and displays them in a temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

‘Z b’ (‘magit-worktree-checkout’)
     Checkout BRANCH in a new worktree at PATH.

‘Z c’ (‘magit-worktree-branch’)
     Create a new BRANCH and check it out in a new worktree at PATH.

‘Z m’ (‘magit-worktree-move’)
     Move an existing worktree to a new PATH.

‘Z k’ (‘magit-worktree-delete’)
     Delete a worktree, defaulting to the worktree at point.  The
     primary worktree cannot be deleted.

‘Z g’ (‘magit-worktree-status’)
     Show the status for the worktree at point.

     If there is no worktree at point, then read one in the minibuffer.
     If the worktree at point is the one whose status is already being
     displayed in the current buffer, then show it in Dired instead.


File: magit.info,  Node: Sparse checkouts,  Next: Bundle,  Prev: Worktree,  Up: Miscellaneous

8.6 Sparse checkouts
====================

Sparse checkouts provide a way to restrict the working tree to a subset
of directories.  See *note (gitman)git-sparse-checkout::.

   *Warning*: Git introduced the ‘git sparse-checkout’ command in
version 2.25 and still advertises it as experimental and subject to
change.  Magit’s interface should be considered the same.  In
particular, if Git introduces a backward incompatible change, Magit’s
sparse checkout functionality may be updated in a way that requires a
more recent Git version.

‘>’ (‘magit-sparse-checkout’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     and displays them in a temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

‘> e’ (‘magit-sparse-checkout-enable’)
     This command initializes a sparse checkout that includes only the
     files in the top-level directory.

     Note that ‘magit-sparse-checkout-set’ and
     ‘magit-sparse-checkout-add’ automatically initialize a sparse
     checkout if necessary.  However, you may want to call
     ‘magit-sparse-checkout-enable’ explicitly to re-initialize a sparse
     checkout after calling ‘magit-sparse-checkout-disable’, to pass
     additional arguments to ‘git sparse-checkout init’, or to execute
     the initialization asynchronously.

‘> s’ (‘magit-sparse-checkout-set’)
     This command takes a list of directories and configures the sparse
     checkout to include only files in those subdirectories.  Any
     previously included directories are excluded unless they are in the
     provided list of directories.

‘> a’ (‘magit-sparse-checkout-add’)
     This command is like ‘magit-sparse-checkout-set’, but instead adds
     the specified list of directories to the set of directories that is
     already included in the sparse checkout.

‘> r’ (‘magit-sparse-checkout-reapply’)
     This command applies the currently configured sparse checkout
     patterns to the working tree.  This is useful to call if excluded
     files have been checked out after operations such as merging or
     rebasing.

‘> d’ (‘magit-sparse-checkout-disable’)
     This command restores the full checkout.  To return to the previous
     sparse checkout, call ‘magit-sparse-checkout-enable’.

   A sparse checkout can also be initiated when cloning a repository by
using the ‘magit-clone-sparse’ command in the ‘magit-clone’ transient
(see *note Cloning Repository::).

   If you want the status buffer to indicate when a sparse checkout is
enabled, add the function ‘magit-sparse-checkout-insert-header’ to
‘magit-status-headers-hook’.

8.7 Bundle
==========

Also see *note (gitman)git-bundle::.

 -- Command: magit-bundle
     This transient prefix command binds several suffix commands for
     running ‘git bundle’ subcommands and displays them in a temporary
     buffer until a suffix is invoked.


File: magit.info,  Node: Common Commands,  Next: Wip Modes,  Prev: Bundle,  Up: Miscellaneous

8.8 Common Commands
===================

 -- Command: magit-switch-to-repository-buffer
 -- Command: magit-switch-to-repository-buffer-other-window
 -- Command: magit-switch-to-repository-buffer-other-frame
 -- Command: magit-display-repository-buffer
     These commands read any existing Magit buffer that belongs to the
     current repository from the user and then switch to the selected
     buffer (without refreshing it).

     The last variant uses ‘magit-display-buffer’ to do so and thus
     respects ‘magit-display-buffer-function’.

   These are some of the commands that can be used in all buffers whose
major-modes derive from ‘magit-mode’.  There are other common commands
beside the ones below, but these didn’t fit well anywhere else.

‘C-w’ (‘magit-copy-section-value’)
     This command saves the value of the current section to the
     ‘kill-ring’, and, provided that the current section is a commit,
     branch, or tag section, it also pushes the (referenced) revision to
     the ‘magit-revision-stack’.

     When the current section is a branch or a tag, and a prefix
     argument is used, then it saves the revision at its tip to the
     ‘kill-ring’ instead of the reference name.

     When the region is active, this command saves that to the
     ‘kill-ring’, like ‘kill-ring-save’ would, instead of behaving as
     described above.  If a prefix argument is used and the region is
     within a hunk, then it strips the diff marker column and keeps only
     either the added or removed lines, depending on the sign of the
     prefix argument.

‘M-w’ (‘magit-copy-buffer-revision’)
     This command saves the revision being displayed in the current
     buffer to the ‘kill-ring’ and also pushes it to the
     ‘magit-revision-stack’.  It is mainly intended for use in
     ‘magit-revision-mode’ buffers, the only buffers where it is always
     unambiguous exactly which revision should be saved.

     Most other Magit buffers usually show more than one revision, in
     some way or another, so this command has to select one of them, and
     that choice might not always be the one you think would have been
     the best pick.

   Outside of Magit ‘M-w’ and ‘C-w’ are usually bound to
‘kill-ring-save’ and ‘kill-region’, and these commands would also be
useful in Magit buffers.  Therefore when the region is active, then both
of these commands behave like ‘kill-ring-save’ instead of as described
above.


File: magit.info,  Node: Wip Modes,  Next: Commands for Buffers Visiting Files,  Prev: Common Commands,  Up: Miscellaneous

8.9 Wip Modes
=============

Git keeps *committed* changes around long enough for users to recover
changes they have accidentally deleted.  It does so by not garbage
collecting any committed but no longer referenced objects for a certain
period of time, by default 30 days.

   But Git does *not* keep track of *uncommitted* changes in the working
tree and not even the index (the staging area).  Because Magit makes it
so convenient to modify uncommitted changes, it also makes it easy to
shoot yourself in the foot in the process.

   For that reason Magit provides a global mode that saves *tracked*
files to work-in-progress references after or before certain actions.
(At present untracked files are never saved and for technical reasons
nothing is saved before the first commit has been created).

   Two separate work-in-progress references are used to track the state
of the index and of the working tree: ‘refs/wip/index/<branchref>’ and
‘refs/wip/wtree/<branchref>’, where ‘<branchref>’ is the full ref of the
current branch, e.g., ‘refs/heads/master’.  When the ‘HEAD’ is detached
then ‘HEAD’ is used in place of ‘<branchref>’.

   Checking out another branch (or detaching ‘HEAD’) causes the use of
different wip refs for subsequent changes.

 -- User Option: magit-wip-mode
     When this mode is enabled, then uncommitted changes are committed
     to dedicated work-in-progress refs whenever appropriate (i.e., when
     dataloss would be a possibility otherwise).

     Setting this variable directly does not take effect; either use the
     Custom interface to do so or call the respective mode function.

     For historic reasons this mode is implemented on top of four other
     ‘magit-wip-*’ modes, which can also be used individually, if you
     want finer control over when the wip refs are updated; but that is
     discouraged.  See *note Legacy Wip Modes::.

   To view the log for a branch and its wip refs use the commands
‘magit-wip-log’ and ‘magit-wip-log-current’.  You should use ‘--graph’
when using these commands.

 -- Command: magit-wip-log
     This command shows the log for a branch and its wip refs.  With a
     negative prefix argument only the worktree wip ref is shown.

     The absolute numeric value of the prefix argument controls how many
     "branches" of each wip ref are shown.  This is only relevant if the
     value of ‘magit-wip-merge-branch’ is ‘nil’.

 -- Command: magit-wip-log-current
     This command shows the log for the current branch and its wip refs.
     With a negative prefix argument only the worktree wip ref is shown.

     The absolute numeric value of the prefix argument controls how many
     "branches" of each wip ref are shown.  This is only relevant if the
     value of ‘magit-wip-merge-branch’ is ‘nil’.

‘X w’ (‘magit-reset-worktree’)
     This command resets the working tree to some commit read from the
     user and defaulting to the commit at point, while keeping the
     ‘HEAD’ and index as-is.

     This can be used to restore files to the state committed to a wip
     ref.  Note that this will discard any unstaged changes that might
     have existed before invoking this command (but of course only after
     committing that to the working tree wip ref).

   Note that even if you enable ‘magit-wip-mode’ this won’t give you
perfect protection.  The most likely scenario for losing changes despite
the use of ‘magit-wip-mode’ is making a change outside Emacs and then
destroying it also outside Emacs.  In some such a scenario, Magit, being
an Emacs package, didn’t get the opportunity to keep you from shooting
yourself in the foot.

   When you are unsure whether Magit did commit a change to the wip
refs, then you can explicitly request that all changes to all tracked
files are being committed.

‘M-x magit-wip-commit’
     This command commits all changes to all tracked files to the index
     and working tree work-in-progress refs.  Like the modes described
     above, it does not commit untracked files, but it does check all
     tracked files for changes.  Use this command when you suspect that
     the modes might have overlooked a change made outside Emacs/Magit.

 -- User Option: magit-wip-namespace
     The namespace used for work-in-progress refs.  It has to end with a
     slash.  The wip refs are named ‘<namespace>index/<branchref>’ and
     ‘<namespace>wtree/<branchref>’.  When snapshots are created while
     the ‘HEAD’ is detached then ‘HEAD’ is used in place of
     ‘<branchref>’.

 -- User Option: magit-wip-mode-lighter
     Mode-line lighter for ‘magit-wip--mode’.

---------------

 -- User Option: magit-wip-merge-branch
     This option controls whether the current branch is merged into the
     wip refs after a new commit was created on the branch.

     If non-nil and the current branch has new commits, then it is
     merged into the wip ref before creating a new wip commit.  This
     makes it easier to inspect wip history and the wip commits are
     never garbage collected.

     If nil and the current branch has new commits, then the wip ref is
     reset to the tip of the branch before creating a new wip commit.
     With this setting wip commits are eventually garbage collected.

   When ‘magit-wip-merge-branch’ is ‘t’, then the history looks like
this:

       *--*--*--*--*--*       refs/wip/index/refs/heads/master
      /     /     /
     A-----B-----C            refs/heads/master

   When ‘magit-wip-merge-branch’ is ‘nil’, then creating a commit on the
real branch and then making a change causes the wip refs to be recreated
to fork from the new commit.  But the old commits on the wip refs are
not lost.  They are still available from the reflog.  To make it easier
to see when the fork point of a wip ref was changed, an additional
commit with the message "restart autosaving" is created on it (‘xxO’
commits below are such boundary commits).

   Starting with

           BI0---BI1    refs/wip/index/refs/heads/master
          /
     A---B              refs/heads/master
          \
           BW0---BW1    refs/wip/wtree/refs/heads/master

   and committing the staged changes and editing and saving a file would
result in

           BI0---BI1        refs/wip/index/refs/heads/master
          /
     A---B---C              refs/heads/master
          \   \
           \   CW0---CW1    refs/wip/wtree/refs/heads/master
            \
             BW0---BW1      refs/wip/wtree/refs/heads/master@{2}

   The fork-point of the index wip ref is not changed until some change
is being staged.  Likewise just checking out a branch or creating a
commit does not change the fork-point of the working tree wip ref.  The
fork-points are not adjusted until there actually is a change that
should be committed to the respective wip ref.

8.9.2 Legacy Wip Modes
----------------------

It is recommended that you use the mode ‘magit-wip-mode’ (which see) and
ignore the existence of the following modes, which are preserved for
historic reasons.

   Setting the following variables directly does not take effect; either
use the Custom interface to do so or call the respective mode functions.

 -- User Option: magit-wip-after-save-mode
     When this mode is enabled, then saving a buffer that visits a file
     tracked in a Git repository causes its current state to be
     committed to the working tree wip ref for the current branch.

 -- User Option: magit-wip-after-apply-mode
     When this mode is enabled, then applying (i.e., staging, unstaging,
     discarding, reversing, and regularly applying) a change to a file
     tracked in a Git repository causes its current state to be
     committed to the index and/or working tree wip refs for the current
     branch.

   If you only ever edit files using Emacs and only ever interact with
Git using Magit, then the above two modes should be enough to protect
each and every change from accidental loss.  In practice nobody does
that.  Two additional modes exists that do commit to the wip refs before
making changes that could cause the loss of earlier changes.

 -- User Option: magit-wip-before-change-mode
     When this mode is enabled, then certain commands commit the
     existing changes to the files they are about to make changes to.

 -- User Option: magit-wip-initial-backup-mode
     When this mode is enabled, then the current version of a file is
     committed to the worktree wip ref before the buffer visiting that
     file is saved for the first time since the buffer was created.

     This backs up the same version of the file that ‘backup-buffer’
     would save.  While ‘backup-buffer’ uses a backup file, this mode
     uses the same worktree wip ref as used by the other Magit Wip
     modes.  Like ‘backup-buffer’, it only does this once; unless you
     kill the buffer and visit the file again only one backup will be
     created per Emacs session.

     This mode ignores the variables that affect ‘backup-buffer’ and can
     be used along-side that function, which is recommended because it
     only backs up files that are tracked in a Git repository.

 -- User Option: magit-wip-after-save-local-mode-lighter
     Mode-line lighter for ‘magit-wip-after-save-local-mode’.

 -- User Option: magit-wip-after-apply-mode-lighter
     Mode-line lighter for ‘magit-wip-after-apply-mode’.

 -- User Option: magit-wip-before-change-mode-lighter
     Mode-line lighter for ‘magit-wip-before-change-mode’.

 -- User Option: magit-wip-initial-backup-mode-lighter
     Mode-line lighter for ‘magit-wip-initial-backup-mode’.

8.10 Commands for Buffers Visiting Files
========================================

By default Magit defines a few global key bindings.  These bindings are
a compromise between providing no bindings at all and providing the
better bindings I would have liked to use instead.  Magit cannot provide
the set of recommended bindings by default because those key sequences
are stricktly reserved for bindings added by the user.  Also see *note
Global Bindings:: and *note (elisp)Key Binding Conventions::.

   To use the recommended bindings, add this to your init file and
restart Emacs.

     (setq magit-define-global-key-bindings 'recommended)

   If you don’t want Magit to add any bindings to the global keymap at
all, add this to your init file and restart Emacs.

     (setq magit-define-global-key-bindings nil)

     Each of these commands is documented individually right below,
     alongside their default key bindings.  The bindings shown above are
     the recommended bindings, which you can enable by following the
     instructions further up.

‘C-c M-g’ (‘magit-file-dispatch’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     and displays them in a temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

‘C-c M-g s’ (‘magit-stage-file’)
‘C-c M-g s’ (‘magit-stage-buffer-file’)
     Stage all changes to the file being visited in the current buffer.
     When not visiting a file, then the first command is used, which
     prompts for a file.

‘C-c M-g u’ (‘magit-unstage-file’)
‘C-c M-g u’ (‘magit-unstage-buffer-file’)
     Unstage all changes to the file being visited in the current
     buffer.  When not visiting a file, then the first command is used,
     which prompts for a file.

‘C-c M-g , x’ (‘magit-file-untrack’)
     This command untracks a file read from the user, defaulting to the
     visited file.

‘C-c M-g , r’ (‘magit-file-rename’)
     This command renames a file read from the user, defaulting to the
     visited file.

‘C-c M-g , k’ (‘magit-file-delete’)
     This command deletes a file read from the user, defaulting to the
     visited file.

‘C-c M-g , c’ (‘magit-file-checkout’)
     This command updates a file in the working tree and index to the
     contents from a revision.  Both the revision and file are read from
     the user.

‘C-c M-g D’ (‘magit-diff’)
     This transient prefix command binds several diff suffix commands
     and infix arguments and displays them in a temporary buffer until a
     suffix is invoked.  See *note Diffing::.

     This is the same command that ‘d’ is bound to in Magit buffers.  If
     this command is invoked from a file-visiting buffer, then the
     initial value of the option (‘--’) that limits the diff to certain
     file(s) is set to the visited file.

‘C-c M-g d’ (‘magit-diff-buffer-file’)
     This command shows the diff for the file of blob that the current
     buffer visits.

 -- User Option: magit-diff-buffer-file-locked
     This option controls whether ‘magit-diff-buffer-file’ uses a
     dedicated buffer.  See *note Modes and Buffers::.

‘C-c M-g L’ (‘magit-log’)
     This transient prefix command binds several log suffix commands and
     infix arguments and displays them in a temporary buffer until a
     suffix is invoked.  See *note Logging::.

     This is the same command that ‘l’ is bound to in Magit buffers.  If
     this command is invoked from a file-visiting buffer, then the
     initial value of the option (‘--’) that limits the log to certain
     file(s) is set to the visited file.

‘C-c M-g l’ (‘magit-log-buffer-file’)
     This command shows the log for the file of blob that the current
     buffer visits.  Renames are followed when a prefix argument is used
     or when ‘--follow’ is an active log argument.  When the region is
     active, the log is restricted to the selected line range.

 -- User Option: magit-log-buffer-file-locked
     This option controls whether ‘magit-log-buffer-file’ uses a
     dedicated buffer.  See *note Modes and Buffers::.

‘C-c M-g t’ (‘magit-log-trace-definition’)
     This command shows the log for the definition at point.

‘C-c M-g M’ (‘magit-log-merged’)
     This command reads a commit and a branch in shows a log concerning
     the merge of the former into the latter.  This shows multiple
     commits even in case of a fast-forward merge.

‘C-c M-g B’ (‘magit-blame’)
     This transient prefix command binds all blaming suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

     For more information about this and the following commands also see
     *note Blaming::.

     In addition to the ‘magit-blame’ sub-transient, the dispatch
     transient also binds several blaming suffix commands directly.  See
     *note Blaming:: for information about those commands and bindings.

‘C-c M-g p’ (‘magit-blob-previous’)
     This command visits the previous blob which modified the current
     file.

‘C-c M-g n’ (‘magit-blob-next’)
     This command visits the next blob which modified the current file.

‘C-c M-g v’ (‘magit-find-file’)
     This command reads a revision and file and visits the respective
     blob.

‘C-c M-g V’ (‘magit-blob-visit-file’)
     This command visits the file from the working tree, corresponding
     to the current blob.  When visiting a blob or the version from the
     index, then it goes to the same location in the respective file in
     the working tree.

‘C-c M-g g’ (‘magit-status-here’)
     This command displays the status of the current repository in a
     buffer, like ‘magit-status’ does.  Additionally it tries to go to
     the position in that buffer, which corresponds to the position in
     the current file-visiting buffer (if any).

‘C-c M-g G’ (‘magit-display-repository-buffer’)
     This command reads and displays a Magit buffer belonging to the
     current repository, without refreshing it.

‘C-c M-g c’ (‘magit-commit’)
     This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands
     along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a
     temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.  See *note Initiating a
     Commit::.

‘C-c M-g e’ (‘magit-edit-line-commit’)
     This command makes the commit editable that added the current line.

     With a prefix argument it makes the commit editable that removes
     the line, if any.  The commit is determined using ‘git blame’ and
     made editable using ‘git rebase --interactive’ if it is reachable
     from ‘HEAD’, or by checking out the commit (or a branch that points
     at it) otherwise.

8.11 Minor Mode for Buffers Visiting Blobs
==========================================

The ‘magit-blob-mode’ enables certain Magit features in blob-visiting
buffers.  Such buffers can be created using ‘magit-find-file’ and some
of the commands mentioned below, which also take care of turning on this
minor mode.  Currently this mode only establishes a few key bindings,
but this might be extended.

‘p’ (‘magit-blob-previous’)
     Visit the previous blob which modified the current file.

‘n’ (‘magit-blob-next’)
     Visit the next blob which modified the current file.

‘q’ (‘magit-kill-this-buffer’)
     Kill the current buffer.

9 Customizing
*************

Both Git and Emacs are highly customizable.  Magit is both a Git
porcelain as well as an Emacs package, so it makes sense to customize it
using both Git variables as well as Emacs options.  However this
flexibility doesn’t come without problems, including but not limited to
the following.

   • Some Git variables automatically have an effect in Magit without
     requiring any explicit support.  Sometimes that is desirable - in
     other cases, it breaks Magit.

     When a certain Git setting breaks Magit but you want to keep using
     that setting on the command line, then that can be accomplished by
     overriding the value for Magit only by appending something like
     ‘("-c" "some.variable=compatible-value")’ to
     ‘magit-git-global-arguments’.

   • Certain settings like ‘fetch.prune=true’ are respected by Magit
     commands (because they simply call the respective Git command) but
     their value is not reflected in the respective transient buffers.
     In this case the ‘--prune’ argument in ‘magit-fetch’ might be
     active or inactive, but that doesn’t keep the Git variable from
     being honored by the suffix commands anyway.  So pruning might
     happen despite the ‘--prune’ arguments being displayed in a way
     that seems to indicate that no pruning will happen.

   I intend to address these and similar issues in a future release.

* Per-Repository Configuration::
* Essential Settings::


File: magit.info,  Node: Per-Repository Configuration,  Next: Essential Settings,  Up: Customizing

9.1 Per-Repository Configuration
================================

Magit can be configured on a per-repository level using both Git
variables as well as Emacs options.

   To set a Git variable for one repository only, simply set it in
‘/path/to/repo/.git/config’ instead of ‘$HOME/.gitconfig’ or
‘/etc/gitconfig’.  See *note (gitman)git-config::.

   Similarly, Emacs options can be set for one repository only by
editing ‘/path/to/repo/.dir-locals.el’.  See *note (emacs)Directory
Variables::.  For example to disable automatic refreshes of
file-visiting buffers in just one huge repository use this:

   • ‘/path/to/huge/repo/.dir-locals.el’

          ((nil . ((magit-refresh-buffers . nil))))

   It might only be costly to insert certain information into Magit
buffers for repositories that are exceptionally large, in which case you
can disable the respective section inserters just for that repository:

   • ‘/path/to/tag/invested/repo/.dir-locals.el’

          ((magit-status-mode
            . ((eval . (magit-disable-section-inserter 'magit-insert-tags-header)))))

 -- Function: magit-disable-section-inserter fn
     This function disables the section inserter FN in the current
     repository.  It is only intended for use in ‘.dir-locals.el’ and
     ‘.dir-locals-2.el’.

   If you want to apply the same settings to several, but not all,
repositories then keeping the repository-local config files in sync
would quickly become annoying.  To avoid that you can create config
files for certain classes of repositories (e.g., "huge repositories")
and then include those files in the per-repository config files.  For
example:

   • ‘/path/to/huge/repo/.git/config’

          [include]
                  path = /path/to/huge-gitconfig

   • ‘/path/to/huge-gitconfig’

          [status]
                  showUntrackedFiles = no

   • ‘$HOME/.emacs.d/init.el’

          (dir-locals-set-class-variables 'huge-git-repository
             '((nil . ((magit-refresh-buffers . nil)))))

          (dir-locals-set-directory-class
             "/path/to/huge/repo/" 'huge-git-repository)

9.2 Essential Settings
======================

The next three sections list and discuss several variables that many
users might want to customize, for safety and/or performance reasons.

* Menu:

* Safety::
* Performance::
* Global Bindings::


File: magit.info,  Node: Safety,  Next: Performance,  Up: Essential Settings

9.2.1 Safety
------------

This section discusses various variables that you might want to change
(or *not* change) for safety reasons.

   Git keeps *committed* changes around long enough for users to recover
changes they have accidentally been deleted.  It does not do the same
for *uncommitted* changes in the working tree and not even the index
(the staging area).  Because Magit makes it so easy to modify
uncommitted changes, it also makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot
in the process.  For that reason Magit provides three global modes that
save *tracked* files to work-in-progress references after or before
certain actions.  See *note Wip Modes::.

   These modes are not enabled by default because of performance
concerns.  Instead a lot of potentially destructive commands require
confirmation every time they are used.  In many cases this can be
disabled by adding a symbol to ‘magit-no-confirm’ (see *note Completion
and Confirmation::).  If you enable the various wip modes then you
should add ‘safe-with-wip’ to this list.

   Similarly it isn’t necessary to require confirmation before moving a
file to the system trash - if you trashed a file by mistake then you can
recover it from there.  Option ‘magit-delete-by-moving-to-trash’
controls whether the system trash is used, which is the case by default.
Nevertheless, ‘trash’ isn’t a member of ‘magit-no-confirm’ - you might
want to change that.

   By default buffers visiting files are automatically reverted when the
visited file changes on disk.  This isn’t as risky as it might seem, but
to make an informed decision you should see *note Risk of Reverting
Automatically::.


File: magit.info,  Node: Performance,  Next: Global Bindings,  Prev: Safety,  Up: Essential Settings

9.2.2 Performance
-----------------

After Magit has run ‘git’ for side-effects, it also refreshes the
current Magit buffer and the respective status buffer.  This is
necessary because otherwise outdated information might be displayed
without the user noticing.  Magit buffers are updated by recreating
their content from scratch, which makes updating simpler and less
error-prone, but also more costly.  Keeping it simple and just
re-creating everything from scratch is an old design decision and
departing from that will require major refactoring.

   I plan to do that in time for the next major release.  I also intend
to create logs and diffs asynchronously, which should also help a lot
but also requires major refactoring.

   Meanwhile you can tell Magit to only automatically refresh the
current Magit buffer, but not the status buffer.  If you do that, then
the status buffer is only refreshed automatically if it is the current
buffer.

     (setq magit-refresh-status-buffer nil)

   You should also check whether any third-party packages have added
anything to ‘magit-refresh-buffer-hook’, ‘magit-status-refresh-hook’,
‘magit-pre-refresh-hook’, and ‘magit-post-refresh-hook’.  If so, then
check whether those additions impact performance significantly.

   Magit can be told to refresh buffers verbosely using ‘M-x
magit-toggle-verbose-refresh’.  Enabling this helps figuring out which
sections are bottlenecks.  The additional output can be found in the
‘*Messages*’ buffer.

   Magit also reverts buffers for visited files located inside the
current repository when the visited file changes on disk.  That is
implemented on top of ‘auto-revert-mode’ from the built-in library
‘autorevert’.  To figure out whether that impacts performance, check
whether performance is significantly worse, when many buffers exist
and/or when some buffers visit files using TRAMP.  If so, then this
should help.

     (setq auto-revert-buffer-list-filter
           'magit-auto-revert-repository-buffer-p)

   For alternative approaches see *note Automatic Reverting of
File-Visiting Buffers::.

   If you have enabled any features that are disabled by default, then
you should check whether they impact performance significantly.  It’s
likely that they were not enabled by default because it is known that
they reduce performance at least in large repositories.

   If performance is only slow inside certain unusually large
repositories, then you might want to disable certain features on a
per-repository or per-repository-class basis only.  See *note
Per-Repository Configuration::.  For example it takes a long time to
determine the next and current tag in repository with exceptional
numbers of tags.  It would therefore be a good idea to disable
‘magit-insert-tags-headers’, as explained at the mentioned node.

Log Performance
...............

When showing logs, Magit limits the number of commits initially shown in
the hope that this avoids unnecessary work.  When ‘--graph’ is used,
then this unfortunately does not have the desired effect for large
histories.  Junio, Git’s maintainer, said on the git mailing list
(<https://www.spinics.net/lists/git/msg232230.html>): "‘--graph’ wants
to compute the whole history and the max-count only affects the output
phase after ‘--graph’ does its computation".

   In other words, it’s not that Git is slow at outputting the
differences, or that Magit is slow at parsing the output - the problem
is that Git first goes outside and has a smoke.

   We actually work around this issue by limiting the number of commits
not only by using ‘-<N>’ but by also using a range.  But unfortunately
that’s not always possible.

   When more than a few thousand commits are shown, then the use of
‘--graph’ can slow things down.

   Using ‘--color --graph’ is even slower.  Magit uses code that is part
of Emacs to turn control characters into faces.  That code is pretty
slow and this is quite noticeable when showing a log with many branches
and merges.  For that reason ‘--color’ is not enabled by default
anymore.  Consider leaving it at that.

Diff Performance
................

If diffs are slow, then consider turning off some optional diff features
by setting all or some of the following variables to ‘nil’:
‘magit-diff-highlight-indentation’, ‘magit-diff-highlight-trailing’,
‘magit-diff-paint-whitespace’, ‘magit-diff-highlight-hunk-body’, and
‘magit-diff-refine-hunk’.

   When showing a commit instead of some arbitrary diff, then some
additional information is displayed.  Calculating this information can
be quite expensive given certain circumstances.  If looking at a commit
using ‘magit-revision-mode’ takes considerably more time than looking at
the same commit in ‘magit-diff-mode’, then consider setting
‘magit-revision-insert-related-refs’ to ‘nil’.

   When you are often confronted with diffs that contain deleted files,
then you might want to enable the ‘--irreversible-delete’ argument.  If
you do that then diffs still show that a file was deleted but without
also showing the complete deleted content of the file.  This argument is
not available by default, see *note (transient)Enabling and Disabling
Suffixes::.  Once you have done that you should enable it and save that
setting, see *note (transient)Saving Values::.  You should do this in
both the diff (‘d’) and the diff refresh (‘D’) transient popups.

Refs Buffer Performance
.......................

When refreshing the "references buffer" is slow, then that’s usually
because several hundred refs are being displayed.  The best way to
address that is to display fewer refs, obviously.

   If you are not, or only mildly, interested in seeing the list of
tags, then start by not displaying them:

     (remove-hook 'magit-refs-sections-hook 'magit-insert-tags)

   Then you should also make sure that the listed remote branches
actually all exist.  You can do so by pruning branches which no longer
exist using ‘f-pa’.

Committing Performance
......................

When you initiate a commit, then Magit by default automatically shows a
diff of the changes you are about to commit.  For large commits this can
take a long time, which is especially distracting when you are
committing large amounts of generated data which you don’t actually
intend to inspect before committing.  This behavior can be turned off
using:

     (remove-hook 'server-switch-hook 'magit-commit-diff)
     (remove-hook 'with-editor-filter-visit-hook 'magit-commit-diff)

   Then you can type ‘C-c C-d’ to show the diff when you actually want
to see it, but only then.  Alternatively you can leave the hook alone
and just type ‘C-g’ in those cases when it takes too long to generate
the diff.  If you do that, then you will end up with a broken diff
buffer, but doing it this way has the advantage that you usually get to
see the diff, which is useful because it increases the odds that you
spot potential issues.

Microsoft Windows Performance
.............................

In order to update the status buffer, ‘git’ has to be run a few dozen
times.  That is problematic on Microsoft Windows, because that operating
system is exceptionally slow at starting processes.  Sadly this is an
issue that can only be fixed by Microsoft itself, and they don’t appear
to be particularly interested in doing so.

   Beside the subprocess issue, there are also other Windows-specific
performance issues.  Some of these have workarounds.  The maintainers of
"Git for Windows" try to improve performance on Windows.  Always use the
latest release in order to benefit from the latest performance tweaks.
Magit too tries to work around some Windows-specific issues.

   According to some sources, setting the following Git variables can
also help.

     git config --global core.preloadindex true   # default since v2.1
     git config --global core.fscache true        # default since v2.8
     git config --global gc.auto 256

   You should also check whether an anti-virus program is affecting
performance.

MacOS Performance
.................

Before Emacs 26.1 child processes were created using ‘fork’ on macOS.
That needlessly copied GUI resources, which is expensive.  The result
was that forking took about 30 times as long on Darwin than on Linux,
and because Magit starts many ‘git’ processes that made quite a
difference.

   So make sure that you are using at least Emacs 26.1, in which case
the faster ‘vfork’ will be used.  (The creation of child processes still
takes about twice as long on Darwin compared to Linux.)  See (1) for
more information.

   Additionally, ‘git’ installed from a package manager like ‘brew’ or
‘nix’ seems to be slower than the native executable.  Profile the ‘git’
executable you’re running against the one at ‘/usr/bin/git’, and if you
notice a notable difference try using the latter as
‘magit-git-executable’.

File: magit.info,  Node: Global Bindings,  Prev: Performance,  Up: Essential Settings

9.2.3 Global Bindings
---------------------

 -- User Option: magit-define-global-key-bindings
     This option controls which set of Magit key bindings, if any, may
     be added to the global keymap, even before Magit is first used in
     the current Emacs session.

        • If the value is ‘nil’, no bindings are added.

        • If ‘default’, maybe add:

          ‘C-x g’     ‘magit-status’
          ‘C-x M-g’   ‘magit-dispatch’
          ‘C-c M-g’   ‘magit-file-dispatch’

        • If ‘recommended’, maybe add:

          ‘C-x g’   ‘magit-status’
          ‘C-c g’   ‘magit-dispatch’
          ‘C-c f’   ‘magit-file-dispatch’

          These bindings are strongly recommended, but we cannot use
          them by default, because the ‘C-c <LETTER>’ namespace is
          strictly reserved for bindings added by the user (see *note
          (elisp)Key Binding Conventions::).

     The bindings in the chosen set may be added when ‘after-init-hook’
     is run.  Each binding is added if, and only if, at that time no
     other key is bound to the same command, and no other command is
     bound to the same key.  In other words we try to avoid adding
     bindings that are unnecessary, as well as bindings that conflict
     with other bindings.

     Adding these bindings is delayed until ‘after-init-hook’ is run to
     allow users to set the variable anywhere in their init file
     (without having to make sure to do so before ‘magit’ is loaded or
     autoloaded) and to increase the likelihood that all the potentially
     conflicting user bindings have already been added.

     To set this variable use either ‘setq’ or the Custom interface.  Do
     not use the function ‘customize-set-variable’ because doing that
     would cause Magit to be loaded immediately, when that form is
     evaluated (this differs from ‘custom-set-variables’, which doesn’t
     load the libraries that define the customized variables).

     Setting this variable has no effect if ‘after-init-hook’ has
     already been run.

The following sections describe how to use several of Magit’s core
abstractions to extend Magit itself or implement a separate extension.

   A few of the low-level features used by Magit have been factored out
into separate libraries/packages, so that they can be used by other
packages, without having to depend on Magit.  See *note

doesn’t have a manual yet.

10.1 Calling Git
================

Magit provides many specialized functions for calling Git.  All of these
functions are defined in either ‘magit-git.el’ or ‘magit-process.el’ and
have one of the prefixes ‘magit-run-’, ‘magit-call-’, ‘magit-start-’, or
‘magit-git-’ (which is also used for other things).

   All of these functions accept an indefinite number of arguments,
which are strings that specify command line arguments for Git (or in
some cases an arbitrary executable).  These arguments are flattened
before being passed on to the executable; so instead of strings they can
also be lists of strings and arguments that are ‘nil’ are silently
dropped.  Some of these functions also require a single mandatory
argument before these command line arguments.

   Roughly speaking, these functions run Git either to get some value or
for side-effects.  The functions that return a value are useful to
collect the information necessary to populate a Magit buffer, while the
others are used to implement Magit commands.

   The functions in the value-only group always run synchronously, and
they never trigger a refresh.  The function in the side-effect group can
be further divided into subgroups depending on whether they run Git
synchronously or asynchronously, and depending on whether they trigger a
refresh when the executable has finished.

* Calling Git for Effect::


File: magit.info,  Node: Getting a Value from Git,  Next: Calling Git for Effect,  Up: Calling Git

10.1.1 Getting a Value from Git
-------------------------------

These functions run Git in order to get a value, an exit status, or
output.  Of course you could also use them to run Git commands that have
side-effects, but that should be avoided.

 -- Function: magit-git-exit-code &rest args
     Executes git with ARGS and returns its exit code.

 -- Function: magit-git-success &rest args
     Executes git with ARGS and returns ‘t’ if the exit code is ‘0’,
     ‘nil’ otherwise.

 -- Function: magit-git-failure &rest args
     Executes git with ARGS and returns ‘t’ if the exit code is ‘1’,
     ‘nil’ otherwise.

 -- Function: magit-git-true &rest args
     Executes git with ARGS and returns ‘t’ if the first line printed by
     git is the string "true", ‘nil’ otherwise.

 -- Function: magit-git-false &rest args
     Executes git with ARGS and returns ‘t’ if the first line printed by
     git is the string "false", ‘nil’ otherwise.

 -- Function: magit-git-insert &rest args
     Executes git with ARGS and inserts its output at point.

 -- Function: magit-git-string &rest args
     Executes git with ARGS and returns the first line of its output.
     If there is no output or if it begins with a newline character,
     then this returns ‘nil’.

 -- Function: magit-git-lines &rest args
     Executes git with ARGS and returns its output as a list of lines.
     Empty lines anywhere in the output are omitted.

 -- Function: magit-git-items &rest args
     Executes git with ARGS and returns its null-separated output as a
     list.  Empty items anywhere in the output are omitted.

     If the value of option ‘magit-git-debug’ is non-nil and git exits
     with a non-zero exit status, then warn about that in the echo area
     and add a section containing git’s standard error in the current
     repository’s process buffer.

 -- Function: magit-process-git destination &rest args
     Calls Git synchronously in a separate process, returning its exit
     code.  DESTINATION specifies how to handle the output, like for
     ‘call-process’, except that file handlers are supported.  Enables
     Cygwin’s "noglob" option during the call and ensures unix eol
     conversion.

 -- Function: magit-process-file process &optional infile buffer display
          &rest args
     Processes files synchronously in a separate process.  Identical to
     ‘process-file’ but temporarily enables Cygwin’s "noglob" option
     during the call and ensures unix eol conversion.

   If an error occurs when using one of the above functions, then that
is usually due to a bug, i.e., using an argument which is not actually
supported.  Such errors are usually not reported, but when they occur we
need to be able to debug them.

 -- User Option: magit-git-debug
     Whether to report errors that occur when using ‘magit-git-insert’,
     ‘magit-git-string’, ‘magit-git-lines’, or ‘magit-git-items’.  This
     does not actually raise an error.  Instead a message is shown in
     the echo area, and git’s standard error is insert into a new
     section in the current repository’s process buffer.

 -- Function: magit-git-str &rest args
     This is a variant of ‘magit-git-string’ that ignores the option
     ‘magit-git-debug’.  It is mainly intended to be used while handling
     errors in functions that do respect that option.  Using such a
     function while handing an error could cause yet another error and
     therefore lead to an infinite recursion.  You probably won’t ever
     need to use this function.

10.1.2 Calling Git for Effect
-----------------------------

These functions are used to run git to produce some effect.  Most Magit
commands that actually run git do so by using such a function.

   Because we do not need to consume git’s output when using these
functions, their output is instead logged into a per-repository buffer,
which can be shown using ‘$’ from a Magit buffer or ‘M-x magit-process’
elsewhere.

   These functions can have an effect in two distinct ways.  Firstly,
running git may change something, i.e., create or push a new commit.
Secondly, that change may require that Magit buffers are refreshed to
reflect the changed state of the repository.  But refreshing isn’t
always desirable, so only some of these functions do perform such a
refresh after git has returned.

   Sometimes it is useful to run git asynchronously.  For example, when
the user has just initiated a push, then there is no reason to make her
wait until that has completed.  In other cases it makes sense to wait
for git to complete before letting the user do something else.  For
example after staging a change it is useful to wait until after the
refresh because that also automatically moves to the next change.

 -- Function: magit-call-git &rest args
     Calls git synchronously with ARGS.

 -- Function: magit-call-process program &rest args
     Calls PROGRAM synchronously with ARGS.

 -- Function: magit-run-git &rest args
     Calls git synchronously with ARGS and then refreshes.

 -- Function: magit-run-git-with-input &rest args
     Calls git synchronously with ARGS and sends it the content of the
     current buffer on standard input.

     If the current buffer’s ‘default-directory’ is on a remote
     filesystem, this function actually runs git asynchronously.  But
     then it waits for the process to return, so the function itself is
     synchronous.

 -- Function: magit-git &rest args
     Calls git synchronously with ARGS for side-effects only.  This
     function does not refresh the buffer.

 -- Function: magit-git-wash washer &rest args
     Execute Git with ARGS, inserting washed output at point.  Actually
     first insert the raw output at point.  If there is no output call
     ‘magit-cancel-section’.  Otherwise temporarily narrow the buffer to
     the inserted text, move to its beginning, and then call function
     WASHER with ARGS as its sole argument.

   And now for the asynchronous variants.

 -- Function: magit-run-git-async &rest args
     Start Git, prepare for refresh, and return the process object.
     ARGS is flattened and then used as arguments to Git.

     Display the command line arguments in the echo area.

     After Git returns some buffers are refreshed: the buffer that was
     current when this function was called (if it is a Magit buffer and
     still alive), as well as the respective Magit status buffer.
     Unmodified buffers visiting files that are tracked in the current
     repository are reverted if ‘magit-revert-buffers’ is non-nil.

 -- Function: magit-run-git-with-editor &rest args
     Export GIT_EDITOR and start Git.  Also prepare for refresh and
     return the process object.  ARGS is flattened and then used as
     arguments to Git.

     Display the command line arguments in the echo area.

     After Git returns some buffers are refreshed: the buffer that was
     current when this function was called (if it is a Magit buffer and
     still alive), as well as the respective Magit status buffer.

 -- Function: magit-start-git input &rest args
     Start Git, prepare for refresh, and return the process object.

     If INPUT is non-nil, it has to be a buffer or the name of an
     existing buffer.  The buffer content becomes the processes standard
     input.

     Option ‘magit-git-executable’ specifies the Git executable and
     option ‘magit-git-global-arguments’ specifies constant arguments.
     The remaining arguments ARGS specify arguments to Git.  They are
     flattened before use.

     After Git returns, some buffers are refreshed: the buffer that was
     current when this function was called (if it is a Magit buffer and
     still alive), as well as the respective Magit status buffer.
     Unmodified buffers visiting files that are tracked in the current
     repository are reverted if ‘magit-revert-buffers’ is non-nil.

 -- Function: magit-start-process &rest args
     Start PROGRAM, prepare for refresh, and return the process object.

     If optional argument INPUT is non-nil, it has to be a buffer or the
     name of an existing buffer.  The buffer content becomes the
     processes standard input.

     The process is started using ‘start-file-process’ and then setup to
     use the sentinel ‘magit-process-sentinel’ and the filter
     ‘magit-process-filter’.  Information required by these functions is
     stored in the process object.  When this function returns the
     process has not started to run yet so it is possible to override
     the sentinel and filter.

     After the process returns, ‘magit-process-sentinel’ refreshes the
     buffer that was current when ‘magit-start-process’ was called (if
     it is a Magit buffer and still alive), as well as the respective
     Magit status buffer.  Unmodified buffers visiting files that are
     tracked in the current repository are reverted if
     ‘magit-revert-buffers’ is non-nil.

 -- Variable: magit-this-process
     The child process which is about to start.  This can be used to
     change the filter and sentinel.

 -- Variable: magit-process-raise-error
     When this is non-nil, then ‘magit-process-sentinel’ raises an error
     if git exits with a non-zero exit status.  For debugging purposes.

File: magit.info,  Node: Creating Sections,  Next: Section Selection,  Up: Section Plumbing

10.2.1 Creating Sections
------------------------

 -- Macro: magit-insert-section &rest args
     Insert a section at point.

     TYPE is the section type, a symbol.  Many commands that act on the
     current section behave differently depending on that type.  Also if
     a variable ‘magit-TYPE-section-map’ exists, then use that as the
     text-property ‘keymap’ of all text belonging to the section (but
     this may be overwritten in subsections).  TYPE can also have the
     form ‘(eval FORM)’ in which case FORM is evaluated at runtime.

     Optional VALUE is the value of the section, usually a string that
     is required when acting on the section.

     When optional HIDE is non-nil collapse the section body by default,
     i.e., when first creating the section, but not when refreshing the
     buffer.  Otherwise, expand it by default.  This can be overwritten
     using ‘magit-section-set-visibility-hook’.  When a section is
     recreated during a refresh, then the visibility of predecessor is
     inherited and HIDE is ignored (but the hook is still honored).

     BODY is any number of forms that actually insert the section’s
     heading and body.  Optional NAME, if specified, has to be a symbol,
     which is then bound to the struct of the section being inserted.

     Before BODY is evaluated the ‘start’ of the section object is set
     to the value of ‘point’ and after BODY was evaluated its ‘end’ is
     set to the new value of ‘point’; BODY is responsible for moving
     ‘point’ forward.

     If it turns out inside BODY that the section is empty, then
     ‘magit-cancel-section’ can be used to abort and remove all traces
     of the partially inserted section.  This can happen when creating a
     section by washing Git’s output and Git didn’t actually output
     anything this time around.

 -- Function: magit-insert-heading &rest args
     Insert the heading for the section currently being inserted.

     This function should only be used inside ‘magit-insert-section’.

     When called without any arguments, then just set the ‘content’ slot
     of the object representing the section being inserted to a marker
     at ‘point’.  The section should only contain a single line when
     this function is used like this.

     When called with arguments ARGS, which have to be strings, then
     insert those strings at point.  The section should not contain any
     text before this happens and afterwards it should again only
     contain a single line.  If the ‘face’ property is set anywhere
     inside any of these strings, then insert all of them unchanged.
     Otherwise use the ‘magit-section-heading’ face for all inserted
     text.

     The ‘content’ property of the section struct is the end of the
     heading (which lasts from ‘start’ to ‘content’) and the beginning
     of the body (which lasts from ‘content’ to ‘end’).  If the value of
     ‘content’ is nil, then the section has no heading and its body
     cannot be collapsed.  If a section does have a heading then its
     height must be exactly one line, including a trailing newline
     character.  This isn’t enforced; you are responsible for getting it
     right.  The only exception is that this function does insert a
     newline character if necessary.

 -- Function: magit-cancel-section
     Cancel the section currently being inserted.  This exits the
     innermost call to ‘magit-insert-section’ and removes all traces of
     what has already happened inside that call.

 -- Function: magit-define-section-jumper sym title &optional value
     Define an interactive function to go to section SYM.  TITLE is the
     displayed title of the section.


File: magit.info,  Node: Section Selection,  Next: Matching Sections,  Prev: Creating Sections,  Up: Section Plumbing

10.2.2 Section Selection
------------------------

 -- Function: magit-current-section
     Return the section at point.

 -- Function: magit-region-sections &optional condition multiple
     Return a list of the selected sections.

     When the region is active and constitutes a valid section
     selection, then return a list of all selected sections.  This is
     the case when the region begins in the heading of a section and
     ends in the heading of the same section or in that of a sibling
     section.  If optional MULTIPLE is non-nil, then the region cannot
     begin and end in the same section.

     When the selection is not valid, then return nil.  In this case,
     most commands that can act on the selected sections will instead
     act on the section at point.

     When the region looks like it would in any other buffer then the
     selection is invalid.  When the selection is valid then the region
     uses the ‘magit-section-highlight’ face.  This does not apply to
     diffs where things get a bit more complicated, but even here if the
     region looks like it usually does, then that’s not a valid
     selection as far as this function is concerned.

     If optional CONDITION is non-nil, then the selection not only has
     to be valid; all selected sections additionally have to match
     CONDITION, or nil is returned.  See ‘magit-section-match’ for the
     forms CONDITION can take.

 -- Function: magit-region-values &optional condition multiple
     Return a list of the values of the selected sections.

     Return the values that themselves would be returned by
     ‘magit-region-sections’ (which see).

10.2.3 Matching Sections
------------------------

‘M-x magit-describe-section-briefly’
     Show information about the section at point.  This command is
     intended for debugging purposes.

 -- Function: magit-section-ident section
     Return an unique identifier for SECTION.  The return value has the
     form ‘((TYPE . VALUE)...)’.

 -- Function: magit-get-section ident &optional root
     Return the section identified by IDENT.  IDENT has to be a list as
     returned by ‘magit-section-ident’.

 -- Function: magit-section-match condition &optional section
     Return ‘t’ if SECTION matches CONDITION.  SECTION defaults to the
     section at point.  If SECTION is not specified and there also is no
     section at point, then return ‘nil’.

     CONDITION can take the following forms:
        • ‘(CONDITION...)’

          matches if any of the CONDITIONs matches.

        • ‘[CLASS...]’

          matches if the section’s class is the same as the first CLASS
          or a subclass of that; the section’s parent class matches the
          second CLASS; and so on.

        • ‘[* CLASS...]’

          matches sections that match ‘[CLASS...]’ and also recursively
          all their child sections.

        • ‘CLASS’

          matches if the section’s class is the same as CLASS or a
          subclass of that; regardless of the classes of the parent
          sections.

     Each CLASS should be a class symbol, identifying a class that
     derives from ‘magit-section’.  For backward compatibility CLASS can
     also be a "type symbol".  A section matches such a symbol if the
     value of its ‘type’ slot is ‘eq’.  If a type symbol has an entry in
     ‘magit--section-type-alist’, then a section also matches that type
     if its class is a subclass of the class that corresponds to the
     type as per that alist.

     Note that it is not necessary to specify the complete section
     lineage as printed by ‘magit-describe-section-briefly’, unless of
     course you want to be that precise.

 -- Function: magit-section-value-if condition &optional section
     If the section at point matches CONDITION, then return its value.

     If optional SECTION is non-nil then test whether that matches
     instead.  If there is no section at point and SECTION is nil, then
     return nil.  If the section does not match, then return nil.

     See ‘magit-section-match’ for the forms CONDITION can take.

 -- Function: magit-section-case &rest clauses
     Choose among clauses on the type of the section at point.

     Each clause looks like (CONDITION BODY...).  The type of the
     section is compared against each CONDITION; the BODY forms of the
     first match are evaluated sequentially and the value of the last
     form is returned.  Inside BODY the symbol ‘it’ is bound to the
     section at point.  If no clause succeeds or if there is no section
     at point return nil.

     See ‘magit-section-match’ for the forms CONDITION can take.
     Additionally a CONDITION of t is allowed in the final clause and
     matches if no other CONDITION match, even if there is no section at
     point.

 -- Variable: magit-root-section
     The root section in the current buffer.  All other sections are
     descendants of this section.  The value of this variable is set by
     ‘magit-insert-section’ and you should never modify it.

   For diff related sections a few additional tools exist.

 -- Function: magit-diff-type &optional section
     Return the diff type of SECTION.

     The returned type is one of the symbols ‘staged’, ‘unstaged’,
     ‘committed’, or ‘undefined’.  This type serves a similar purpose as
     the general type common to all sections (which is stored in the
     ‘type’ slot of the corresponding ‘magit-section’ struct) but takes
     additional information into account.  When the SECTION isn’t
     related to diffs and the buffer containing it also isn’t a
     diff-only buffer, then return nil.

     Currently the type can also be one of ‘tracked’ and ‘untracked’,
     but these values are not handled explicitly in every place they
     should be.  A possible fix could be to just return nil here.

     The section has to be a ‘diff’ or ‘hunk’ section, or a section
     whose children are of type ‘diff’.  If optional SECTION is nil,
     return the diff type for the current section.  In buffers whose
     major mode is ‘magit-diff-mode’ SECTION is ignored and the type is
     determined using other means.  In ‘magit-revision-mode’ buffers the
     type is always ‘committed’.

 -- Function: magit-diff-scope &optional section strict
     Return the diff scope of SECTION or the selected section(s).

     A diff’s "scope" describes what part of a diff is selected, it is a
     symbol, one of ‘region’, ‘hunk’, ‘hunks’, ‘file’, ‘files’, or
     ‘list’.  Do not confuse this with the diff "type", as returned by
     ‘magit-diff-type’.

     If optional SECTION is non-nil, then return the scope of that,
     ignoring the sections selected by the region.  Otherwise return the
     scope of the current section, or if the region is active and
     selects a valid group of diff related sections, the type of these
     sections, i.e., ‘hunks’ or ‘files’.  If SECTION (or if the current
     section that is nil) is a ‘hunk’ section and the region starts and
     ends inside the body of a that section, then the type is ‘region’.

     If optional STRICT is non-nil then return nil if the diff type of
     the section at point is ‘untracked’ or the section at point is not
     actually a ‘diff’ but a ‘diffstat’ section.

10.3 Refreshing Buffers
=======================

All commands that create a new Magit buffer or change what is being
displayed in an existing buffer do so by calling ‘magit-mode-setup’.
Among other things, that function sets the buffer local values of
‘default-directory’ (to the top-level of the repository),
‘magit-refresh-function’, and ‘magit-refresh-args’.

   Buffers are refreshed by calling the function that is the local value
of ‘magit-refresh-function’ (a function named ‘magit-*-refresh-buffer’,
where ‘*’ may be something like ‘diff’) with the value of
‘magit-refresh-args’ as arguments.

 -- Macro: magit-mode-setup buffer switch-func mode refresh-func
          &optional refresh-args
     This function displays and selects BUFFER, turns on MODE, and
     refreshes a first time.

     This function displays and optionally selects BUFFER by calling
     ‘magit-mode-display-buffer’ with BUFFER, MODE and SWITCH-FUNC as
     arguments.  Then it sets the local value of
     ‘magit-refresh-function’ to REFRESH-FUNC and that of
     ‘magit-refresh-args’ to REFRESH-ARGS.  Finally it creates the
     buffer content by calling REFRESH-FUNC with REFRESH-ARGS as
     arguments.

     All arguments are evaluated before switching to BUFFER.

 -- Function: magit-mode-display-buffer buffer mode &optional
          switch-function
     This function display BUFFER in some window and select it.  BUFFER
     may be a buffer or a string, the name of a buffer.  The buffer is
     returned.

     Unless BUFFER is already displayed in the selected frame, store the
     previous window configuration as a buffer local value, so that it
     can later be restored by ‘magit-mode-bury-buffer’.

     The buffer is displayed and selected using SWITCH-FUNCTION.  If
     that is ‘nil’ then ‘pop-to-buffer’ is used if the current buffer’s
     major mode derives from ‘magit-mode’.  Otherwise ‘switch-to-buffer’
     is used.

 -- Variable: magit-refresh-function
     The value of this buffer-local variable is the function used to
     refresh the current buffer.  It is called with ‘magit-refresh-args’
     as arguments.

 -- Variable: magit-refresh-args
     The list of arguments used by ‘magit-refresh-function’ to refresh
     the current buffer.  ‘magit-refresh-function’ is called with these
     arguments.

     The value is usually set using ‘magit-mode-setup’, but in some
     cases it’s also useful to provide commands that can change the
     value.  For example, the ‘magit-diff-refresh’ transient can be used
     to change any of the arguments used to display the diff, without
     having to specify again which differences should be shown, but
     ‘magit-diff-more-context’, ‘magit-diff-less-context’ and
     ‘magit-diff-default-context’ change just the ‘-U<N>’ argument.  In
     both case this is done by changing the value of this variable and
     then calling this ‘magit-refresh-function’.

* Theming Faces::


File: magit.info,  Node: Theming Faces,  Up: Conventions

10.4.1 Theming Faces
--------------------

The default theme uses blue for local branches, green for remote
branches, and goldenrod (brownish yellow) for tags.  When creating a new
theme, you should probably follow that example.  If your theme already
uses other colors, then stick to that.

   In older releases these reference faces used to have a background
color and a box around them.  The basic default faces no longer do so,
to make Magit buffers much less noisy, and you should follow that
example at least with regards to boxes.  (Boxes were used in the past to
work around a conflict between the highlighting overlay and text
property backgrounds.  That’s no longer necessary because highlighting
no longer causes other background colors to disappear.)  Alternatively
you can keep the background color and/or box, but then have to take
special care to adjust ‘magit-branch-current’ accordingly.  By default
it looks mostly like ‘magit-branch-local’, but with a box (by default
the former is the only face that uses a box, exactly so that it sticks
out).  If the former also uses a box, then you have to make sure that it
differs in some other way from the latter.

   The most difficult faces to theme are those related to diffs,
headings, highlighting, and the region.  There are faces that fall into
all four groups - expect to spend some time getting this right.

   The ‘region’ face in the default theme, in both the light and dark
variants, as well as in many other themes, distributed with Emacs or by
third-parties, is very ugly.  It is common to use a background color
that really sticks out, which is ugly but if that were the only problem
then it would be acceptable.  Unfortunately many themes also set the
foreground color, which ensures that all text within the region is
readable.  Without doing that there might be cases where some foreground
color is too close to the region background color to still be readable.
But it also means that text within the region loses all syntax
highlighting.

   I consider the work that went into getting the ‘region’ face right to
be a good indicator for the general quality of a theme.  My
recommendation for the ‘region’ face is this: use a background color
slightly different from the background color of the ‘default’ face, and
do not set the foreground color at all.  So for a light theme you might
use a light (possibly tinted) gray as the background color of ‘default’
and a somewhat darker gray for the background of ‘region’.  That should
usually be enough to not collide with the foreground color of any other
face.  But if some other faces also set a light gray as background
color, then you should also make sure it doesn’t collide with those (in
some cases it might be acceptable though).

   Magit only uses the ‘region’ face when the region is "invalid" by its
own definition.  In a Magit buffer the region is used to either select
multiple sibling sections, so that commands which support it act on all
of these sections instead of just the current section, or to select
lines within a single hunk section.  In all other cases, the section is
considered invalid and Magit won’t act on it.  But such invalid sections
happen, either because the user has not moved point enough yet to make
it valid or because she wants to use a non-magit command to act on the
region, e.g., ‘kill-region’.

   So using the regular ‘region’ face for invalid sections is a feature.
It tells the user that Magit won’t be able to act on it.  It’s
acceptable if that face looks a bit odd and even (but less so) if it
collides with the background colors of section headings and other things
that have a background color.

   Magit highlights the current section.  If a section has subsections,
then all of them are highlighted.  This is done using faces that have
"highlight" in their names.  For most sections,
‘magit-section-highlight’ is used for both the body and the heading.
Like the ‘region’ face, it should only set the background color to
something similar to that of ‘default’.  The highlight background color
must be different from both the ‘region’ background color and the
‘default’ background color.

   For diff related sections Magit uses various faces to highlight
different parts of the selected section(s).  Note that hunk headings,
unlike all other section headings, by default have a background color,
because it is useful to have very visible separators between hunks.
That face ‘magit-diff-hunk-heading’, should be different from both
‘magit-diff-hunk-heading-highlight’ and ‘magit-section-highlight’, as
well as from ‘magit-diff-context’ and ‘magit-diff-context-highlight’.
By default we do that by changing the foreground color.  Changing the
background color would lead to complications, and there are already
enough we cannot get around.  (Also note that it is generally a good
idea for section headings to always be bold, but only for sections that
have subsections).

   When there is a valid region selecting diff-related sibling sections,
i.e., multiple files or hunks, then the bodies of all these sections use
the respective highlight faces, but additionally the headings instead
use one of the faces ‘magit-diff-file-heading-selection’ or
‘magit-diff-hunk-heading-selection’.  These faces have to be different
from the regular highlight variants to provide explicit visual
indication that the region is active.

   When theming diff related faces, start by setting the option
‘magit-diff-refine-hunk’ to ‘all’.  You might personally prefer to only
refine the current hunk or not use hunk refinement at all, but some of
the users of your theme want all hunks to be refined, so you have to
cater to that.

   (Also turn on ‘magit-diff-highlight-indentation’,
‘magit-diff-highlight-trailing’, and ‘magit-diff-paint-whitespace’; and
insert some whitespace errors into the code you use for testing.)

   For added lines you have to adjust three faces: ‘magit-diff-added’,
‘magit-diff-added-highlight’, and ‘diff-refined-added’.  Make sure that
the latter works well with both of the former, as well as ‘smerge-other’
and ‘diff-added’.  Then do the same for the removed lines, context
lines, lines added by us, and lines added by them.  Also make sure the
respective added, removed, and context faces use approximately the same
saturation for both the highlighted and unhighlighted variants.  Also
make sure the file and diff headings work nicely with context lines
(e.g., make them look different).  Line faces should set both the
foreground and the background color.  For example, for added lines use
two different greens.

   It’s best if the foreground color of both the highlighted and the
unhighlighted variants are the same, so you will need to have to find a
color that works well on the highlight and unhighlighted background, the
refine background, and the highlight context background.  When there is
an hunk internal region, then the added- and removed-lines background
color is used only within that region.  Outside the region the
highlighted context background color is used.  This makes it easier to
see what is being staged.  With an hunk internal region the hunk heading
is shown using ‘magit-diff-hunk-heading-selection’, and so are the thin
lines that are added around the lines that fall within the region.  The
background color of that has to be distinct enough from the various
other involved background colors.

   Nobody said this would be easy.  If your theme restricts itself to a
certain set of colors, then you should make an exception here.
Otherwise it would be impossible to make the diffs look good in each and
every variation.  Actually you might want to just stick to the default
definitions for these faces.  You have been warned.  Also please note
that if you do not get this right, this will in some cases look to users
like bugs in Magit - so please do it right or not at all.

A.1.1 How to pronounce Magit?
-----------------------------

Either ‘mu[m's] git’ or ‘magi{c => t}’ is fine.

   The slogan is "It’s Magit!  The magical Git client", so it makes
sense to pronounce Magit like magic, while taking into account that C
and T do not sound the same.

   The German "Magie" is not pronounced the same as the English "magic",
so if you speak German then you can use the above rationale to justify
using the former pronunciation; ‘Mag{ie => it}’.

   You can also choose to use the former pronunciation just because you
like it better.

A.1.2 How to show git’s output?
-------------------------------

To show the output of recently run git commands, press ‘$’ (or, if that
isn’t available, ‘M-x magit-process-buffer’).  This will show a buffer
containing a section per git invocation; as always press ‘TAB’ to expand
or collapse them.

   By default, git’s output is only inserted into the process buffer if
it is run for side-effects.  When the output is consumed in some way,
also inserting it into the process buffer would be too expensive.  For
debugging purposes, it’s possible to do so anyway by setting
‘magit-git-debug’ to ‘t’.

A.1.3 How to install the gitman info manual?
--------------------------------------------

Git’s manpages can be exported as an info manual called ‘gitman’.
Magit’s own info manual links to nodes in that manual instead of the
actual manpages because Info doesn’t support linking to manpages.

   Unfortunately some distributions do not install the ‘gitman’ manual
by default and you will have to install a separate documentation package
to get it.

   Magit patches Info adding the ability to visit links to the ‘gitman’
Info manual by instead viewing the respective manpage.  If you prefer
that approach, then set the value of ‘magit-view-git-manual-method’ to
one of the supported packages ‘man’ or ‘woman’, e.g.:

     (setq magit-view-git-manual-method 'man)

A.1.4 How to show diffs for gpg-encrypted files?
------------------------------------------------

Git supports showing diffs for encrypted files, but has to be told to do
so.  Since Magit just uses Git to get the diffs, configuring Git also
affects the diffs displayed inside Magit.

     git config --global diff.gpg.textconv "gpg --no-tty --decrypt"
     echo "*.gpg filter=gpg diff=gpg" > .gitattributes

A.1.6 Should I disable VC?
--------------------------

If you don’t use VC (the built-in version control interface) then you
might be tempted to disable it, not least because we used to recommend
that you do that.

   We no longer recommend that you disable VC.  Doing so would break
useful third-party packages (such as ‘diff-hl’), which depend on VC
being enabled.

   If you choose to disable VC anyway, then you can do so by changing
the value of ‘vc-handled-backends’.

Magit is currently not expected to work well under such conditions.  It

task but I hope to eventually find the time to make it happen.

A.2.3 I am having problems committing

That likely means that Magit is having problems finding an appropriate
emacsclient executable.  See *note (with-editor)Configuring

A.2.4 I am using MS Windows and cannot push with Magit
------------------------------------------------------

It’s almost certain that Magit is only incidental to this issue.  It is
much more likely that this is a configuration issue, even if you can
push on the command line.

   Detailed setup instructions can be found at
<https://github.com/magit/magit/wiki/Pushing-with-Magit-from-Windows>.

A.2.5 I am using macOS and SOMETHING works in shell, but not in Magit
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This usually occurs because Emacs doesn’t have the same environment
variables as your shell.  Try installing and configuring
<https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell>.  By default it
synchronizes ‘$PATH’, which helps Magit find the same ‘git’ as the one
you are using on the shell.

   If SOMETHING is "passphrase caching with gpg-agent for commit and/or
tag signing", then you’ll also need to synchronize ‘$GPG_AGENT_INFO’.


File: magit.info,  Node: Expanding a file to show the diff causes it to disappear,  Next: Point is wrong in the COMMIT_EDITMSG buffer,  Prev: I am using macOS and SOMETHING works in shell but not in Magit,  Up: FAQ - Issues and Errors

A.2.6 Expanding a file to show the diff causes it to disappear
--------------------------------------------------------------

This is probably caused by a customization of a ‘diff.*’ Git variable.
You probably set that variable for a reason, and should therefore only
undo that setting in Magit by customizing ‘magit-git-global-arguments’.


File: magit.info,  Node: Point is wrong in the COMMIT_EDITMSG buffer,  Next: The mode-line information isn't always up-to-date,  Prev: Expanding a file to show the diff causes it to disappear,  Up: FAQ - Issues and Errors

A.2.7 Point is wrong in the ‘COMMIT_EDITMSG’ buffer
---------------------------------------------------

Neither Magit nor ‘git-commit‘ fiddle with point in the buffer used to
write commit messages, so something else must be doing it.

   You have probably globally enabled a mode which restores point in
file-visiting buffers.  It might be a bit surprising, but when you write
a commit message, then you are actually editing a file.

   So you have to figure out which package is doing it.  ‘saveplace’,
‘pointback’, and ‘session’ are likely candidates.  These snippets might
help:

     (setq session-name-disable-regexp "\\(?:\\`'\\.git/[A-Z_]+\\'\\)")

     (with-eval-after-load 'pointback
       (lambda ()
         (when (or git-commit-mode git-rebase-mode)
           (pointback-mode -1))))


File: magit.info,  Node: The mode-line information isn't always up-to-date,  Next: A branch and tag sharing the same name breaks SOMETHING,  Prev: Point is wrong in the COMMIT_EDITMSG buffer,  Up: FAQ - Issues and Errors

A.2.8 The mode-line information isn’t always up-to-date
-------------------------------------------------------

Magit is not responsible for the version control information that is
being displayed in the mode-line and looks something like ‘Git-master’.
The built-in "Version Control" package, also known as "VC", updates that
information, and can be told to do so more often:

     (setq auto-revert-check-vc-info t)

   But doing so isn’t good for performance.  For more (overly
optimistic) information see *note (emacs)VC Mode Line::.

   If you don’t really care about seeing this information in the
mode-line, but just don’t want to see _incorrect_ information, then
consider simply not displaying it in the mode-line:

     (setq-default mode-line-format
                   (delete '(vc-mode vc-mode) mode-line-format))

A.2.9 A branch and tag sharing the same name breaks SOMETHING
-------------------------------------------------------------

Or more generally, ambiguous refnames break SOMETHING.

   Magit assumes that refs are named non-ambiguously across the
"refs/heads/", "refs/tags/", and "refs/remotes/" namespaces (i.e., all
the names remain unique when those prefixes are stripped).  We consider
ambiguous refnames unsupported and recommend that you use a
non-ambiguous naming scheme.  However, if you do work with a repository
that has ambiguous refnames, please report any issues you encounter, so
that we can investigate whether there is a simple fix.

When Magit calls ‘git’ it adds a few global arguments including
‘--literal-pathspecs’ and the ‘git’ process started by Magit then passes
that setting on to other ‘git’ process it starts itself.  It does so by
setting the environment variable ‘GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS’, not by calling
subprocesses with the ‘--literal-pathspecs’ argument.  You can therefore
override this setting in hook scripts using ‘unset
GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS’.

A.2.11 ‘git-commit-mode’ isn’t used when committing from the command-line
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reason for this is that ‘git-commit.el’ has not been loaded yet
and/or that the server has not been started yet.  These things have
always already been taken care of when you commit from Magit because in
order to do so, Magit has to be loaded and doing that involves loading
‘git-commit’ and starting the server.

   If you want to commit from the command-line, then you have to take
care of these things yourself.  Your ‘init.el’ file should contain:

     (require 'git-commit)
     (server-mode)

   Instead of ‘(require ’git-commit)‘ you may also use:

     (load "/path/to/magit-autoloads.el")

   You might want to do that because loading ‘git-commit’ causes large
parts of Magit to be loaded.

   There are also some variations of ‘(server-mode)’ that you might want
to try.  Personally I use:

     (use-package server
       :config (or (server-running-p) (server-mode)))

   Now you can use:

     $ emacs&
     $ EDITOR=emacsclient git commit

   However you cannot use:

     $ killall emacs
     $ EDITOR="emacsclient --alternate-editor emacs" git commit

   This will actually end up using ‘emacs’, not ‘emacsclient’.  If you
do this, then you can still edit the commit message but
‘git-commit-mode’ won’t be used and you have to exit ‘emacs’ to finish
the process.

   Tautology ahead.  If you want to be able to use ‘emacsclient’ to
connect to a running ‘emacs’ instance, even though no ‘emacs’ instance
is running, then you cannot use ‘emacsclient’ directly.

   Instead you have to create a script that does something like this:

   Try to use ‘emacsclient’ (without using ‘--alternate-editor’).  If
that succeeds, do nothing else.  Otherwise start ‘emacs &’ (and
‘init.el’ must call ‘server-start’) and try to use ‘emacsclient’ again.

A.2.12 Point ends up inside invisible text when jumping to a file-visiting buffer
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This can happen when you type ‘RET’ on a hunk to visit the respective
file at the respective position.  One solution to this problem is to use
‘global-reveal-mode’.  It makes sure that text around point is always
visible.  If that is too drastic for your taste, then you may instead
use ‘magit-diff-visit-file-hook’ to reveal the text, possibly using
‘reveal-post-command’ or for Org buffers ‘org-reveal’.

A.2.13 I am no longer able to save popup defaults
-------------------------------------------------

Magit used to use Magit-Popup to implement the transient popup menus.
Now it used Transient instead, which is Magit-Popup’s successor.

   In the older Magit-Popup menus, it was possible to save user settings
(e.g., setting the gpg signing key for commits) by using ‘C-c C-c’ in
the popup buffer.  This would dismiss the popup, but save the settings
as the defaults for future popups.

   When switching to Transient menus, this functionality is now
available via ‘C-x C-s’ instead; the ‘C-x’ prefix has other options as
well when using Transient, which will be displayed when it is typed.
See <https://magit.vc/manual/transient/Saving-Values.html#Saving-Values>
for more details.

B Debugging Tools
*****************

Magit and its dependencies provide a few debugging tools, and we
appreciate it very much if you use those tools before reporting an
issue.  Please include all relevant output when reporting an issue.

‘M-x magit-version’
     This command shows the currently used versions of Magit, Git, and
     Emacs in the echo area.  Non-interactively this just returns the
     Magit version.

‘M-x magit-emacs-Q-command’
     This command shows a debugging shell command in the echo area and
     adds it to the kill ring.  Paste that command into a shell and run
     it.

     This shell command starts ‘emacs’ with only ‘magit’ and its
     dependencies loaded.  Neither your configuration nor other
     installed packages are loaded.  This makes it easier to determine
     whether some issue lays with Magit or something else.

     If you run Magit from its Git repository, then you should be able
     to use ‘make emacs-Q’ instead of the output of this command.

‘M-x magit-toggle-git-debug’
     This command toggles whether additional git errors are reported.

     Magit basically calls git for one of these two reasons: for
     side-effects or to do something with its standard output.

     When git is run for side-effects then its output, including error
     messages, go into the process buffer which is shown when using ‘$’.

     When git’s output is consumed in some way, then it would be too
     expensive to also insert it into this buffer, but when this option
     is non-nil and git returns with a non-zero exit status, then at
     least its standard error is inserted into this buffer.

     This is only intended for debugging purposes.  Do not enable this
     permanently, that would negatively affect performance.  Also note
     that just because git exits with a non-zero exit status and prints
     an error message that usually doesn’t mean that it is an error as
     far as Magit is concerned, which is another reason we usually hide
     these error messages.  Whether some error message is relevant in
     the context of some unexpected behavior has to be judged on a case
     by case basis.

‘M-x magit-toggle-verbose-refresh’
     This command toggles whether Magit refreshes buffers verbosely.
     Enabling this helps figuring out which sections are bottlenecks.
     The additional output can be found in the ‘*Messages*’ buffer.

‘M-x magit-debug-git-executable’
     This command displays a buffer containing information about the
     available and used ‘git’ executable(s), and can be useful when
     investigating ‘exec-path’ issues.

     Also see *note Git Executable::.

‘M-x with-editor-debug’
     This command displays a buffer containing information about the
     available and used ‘emacsclient’ executable(s), and can be useful
     when investigating why Magit (or rather ‘with-editor’) cannot find
     an appropriate ‘emacsclient’ executable.

     Also see *note (with-editor)Debugging::.

Please also see *note FAQ::.
