(defvar magit-define-global-key-bindings 'default "\
Which set of key bindings to add to the global keymap, if any.

This option controls which set of Magit key bindings, if any, may
be added to the global keymap, even before Magit is first used in
the current Emacs session.

If the value is nil, no bindings are added.

If `default', maybe add:

    C-x g     `magit-status'
    C-x M-g   `magit-dispatch'
    C-c M-g   `magit-file-dispatch'

If `recommended', maybe add:

    C-x g     `magit-status'
    C-c g     `magit-dispatch'
    C-c f     `magit-file-dispatch'

    These bindings are strongly recommended, but we cannot use
    them by default, because the \"C-c <LETTER>\" namespace is
    strictly reserved for bindings added by the user.

The bindings in the chosen set may be added when
`after-init-hook' is run.  Each binding is added if, and only
if, at that time no other key is bound to the same command,
and no other command is bound to the same key.  In other words
we try to avoid adding bindings that are unnecessary, as well
as bindings that conflict with other bindings.

Adding these bindings is delayed until `after-init-hook' is
run to allow users to set the variable anywhere in their init
file (without having to make sure to do so before `magit' is
loaded or autoloaded) and to increase the likelihood that all
the potentially conflicting user bindings have already been
added.

To set this variable use either `setq' or the Custom interface.
Do not use the function `customize-set-variable' because doing
that would cause Magit to be loaded immediately, when that form
is evaluated (this differs from `custom-set-variables', which
doesn't load the libraries that define the customized variables).

Setting this variable has no effect if `after-init-hook' has
already been run.")

This is useful to create a feature branch after work has already

If the current branch is a member of the value of option

the commit that is the fewest commits ahead of the source
branch.

The commit at the other end of the selection actually does not

but that is discouraged.

This is a global minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Magit-Wip mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive,
enable the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `(default-value \\='magit-wip-mode)'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.
