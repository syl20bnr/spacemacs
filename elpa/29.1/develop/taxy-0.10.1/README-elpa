/Now, where did I put that…/

This library provides a programmable way to classify arbitrary objects
into a hierarchical taxonomy.  (That's a lot of fancy words to say that
this lets you automatically put things in nested groups.)

Helpful features include:

Dynamic taxonomies
      Objects may be classified into hierarchies automatically defined
      at runtime based on their attributes.
Reusable taxonomies
      Taxonomy definitions may be stored in variables and reused in
      other taxonomies' descendant groups.
Classification domain-specific language
      Easily define a custom DSL used to classify items dynamically
      (which can be extended by users).
Flexible table view
      Based on `magit-section', with easily defined columns (also
      extendable by users).

  May these examples help you classify your understanding.


1.1 Numbery (starting basically)
────────────────────────────────

  Let's imagine a silly taxonomy of numbers below 100:

  ┌────
  │ ("Numbery" "A silly taxonomy of numbers."
  │  (("< 10" "Numbers below 10"
  │    ;; These numbers are leftovers from the sub-taxys below.
  │    (0 2 4 6 8)
  │    ;; These sub-taxys further classify the numbers below 10 into odd
  │    ;; and even.  The odd taxy "consumes" numbers, while the even one
  │    ;; doesn't, leaving them to reappear in the parent taxy's items.
  │    (("Odd" "(consuming)"
  │      (1 3 5 7 9))
  │     ("Even" "(non-consuming)"
  │      (0 2 4 6 8))))
  │   (">= 10" "Numbers above 9"
  │    ;; Like in the "< 10" taxy, these numbers are leftovers from this
  │    ;; taxy's sub-taxys, three of which are non-consuming.
  │    (10 11 13 14 17 19 22 23 25 26 29 31 34 35 37 38 41 43 46 47 49 50 53 55 58
  │        59 61 62 65 67 70 71 73 74 77 79 82 83 85 86 89 91 94 95 97 98)
  │    (("Divisible by 3" "(non-consuming)"
  │      (12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33 36 39 42 45 48 51 54 57 60 63 66 69 72 75 78 81 84
  │ 	 87 90 93 96 99))
  │     ("Divisible by 4" "(non-consuming)"
  │      (12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96))
  │     ("Divisible by 3 or 4" "(consuming)"
  │      ;; This taxy consumes numbers it takes in, but since these
  │      ;; numbers have already been taken in (without being consumed) by
  │      ;; the previous two sibling taxys, they may also appear in them.
  │      (12 15 16 18 20 21 24 27 28 30 32 33 36 39 40 42 44 45 48 51 52 54 56 57 60
  │ 	 63 64 66 68 69 72 75 76 78 80 81 84 87 88 90 92 93 96 99))
  │     ("Divisible by 5" "(non-consuming)"
  │      (10 25 35 50 55 65 70 85 95))))))
  └────

  You might think about how to produce that by writing some imperative
  code, but `taxy' allows you to do so in a more declarative and
  functional manner:

  ┌────
  │ (require 'taxy)
  │ 
  │ (defvar numbery
  │   (make-taxy
  │    :name "Numbery"
  │    :description "A silly taxonomy of numbers."
  │    :taxys (list (make-taxy
  │ 		 :name "< 10"
  │ 		 :description "Numbers below 10 (consuming)"
  │ 		 :predicate (lambda (n) (< n 10))
  │ 		 :taxys (list
  │ 			 ;; These sub-taxys further classify the numbers below 10 into odd
  │ 			 ;; and even.  The odd taxy "consumes" numbers, while the even one
  │ 			 ;; doesn't, leaving them to reappear in the parent taxy's items.
  │ 			 (make-taxy :name "Odd"
  │ 				    :description "(consuming)"
  │ 				    :predicate #'oddp)
  │ 			 (make-taxy :name "Even"
  │ 				    :description "(non-consuming)"
  │ 				    :predicate #'evenp
  │ 				    :then #'identity)))
  │ 		(make-taxy
  │ 		 :name ">= 10"
  │ 		 :description "Numbers above 9 (consuming)"
  │ 		 :predicate (lambda (n) (>= n 10))
  │ 		 :taxys (list
  │ 			 ;; Like in the "< 10" taxy, these sub-taxys further classify
  │ 			 ;; the numbers, but only one of them consumes numbers it
  │ 			 ;; takes in, leaving the rest to reappear in the parent taxy.
  │ 			 (make-taxy :name "Divisible by 3"
  │ 				    :description "(non-consuming)"
  │ 				    :predicate (lambda (n) (zerop (mod n 3)))
  │ 				    :then #'identity)
  │ 			 (make-taxy :name "Divisible by 4"
  │ 				    :description "(non-consuming)"
  │ 				    :predicate (lambda (n) (zerop (mod n 4)))
  │ 				    :then #'identity)
  │ 			 (make-taxy :name "Divisible by 3 or 4"
  │ 				    :description "(consuming)"
  │ 				    ;; Since this taxy's `:then' function is unset,
  │ 				    ;; it defaults to `ignore', which causes it to
  │ 				    ;; consume numbers it takes in.  Since these
  │ 				    ;; numbers have already been taken in (without
  │ 				    ;; being consumed) by the previous two sibling
  │ 				    ;; taxys, they also appear in them.
  │ 				    :predicate (lambda (n) (or (zerop (mod n 3))
  │ 							       (zerop (mod n 4)))))
  │ 			 (make-taxy :name "Divisible by 5"
  │ 				    :description "(non-consuming)"
  │ 				    :predicate (lambda (n) (zerop (mod n 5)))
  │ 				    :then #'identity))))))
  │ 
  │ (let ((numbers (cl-loop for i below 100 collect i))
  │       ;; Since `numbery' is stored in a variable, we use an emptied
  │       ;; copy of it to avoid mutating the original taxy.
  │       (taxy (taxy-emptied numbery)))
  │   (taxy-plain (taxy-fill (reverse numbers) taxy)))
  └────

  The `taxy-fill' function applies the numbers in a "cascade" down the
  hierarchy of "taxys", and the `taxy-plain' function returns a
  meaningful subset of the taxys' slots, suitable for display.


1.2 Lettery (filling incrementally)
───────────────────────────────────

  You can also add more items after the hierarchy has been filled.  In
  this example we'll make a comprehensive taxonomy of letters.  The
  first sub-taxy collects vowels, and the second, by leaving its
  predicate at the default value, `identity', collects all letters not
  collected by the first taxy, i.e. non-vowels.

  ┌────
  │ (defvar lettery
  │   (make-taxy
  │    :name "Lettery"
  │    :description "A comprehensive taxonomy of letters."
  │    :taxys (list (make-taxy
  │ 		 :name "Vowels"
  │ 		 :description "You know what those are."
  │ 		 :predicate (lambda (l)
  │ 			      (member-ignore-case l '("a" "e" "i" "o" "u"))))
  │ 		(make-taxy
  │ 		 :name "Consonants"
  │ 		 :description "Well, if they aren't vowels..."))))
  │ 
  │ (taxy-plain
  │  (taxy-fill (reverse
  │ 	     (cl-loop for l from ?a to ?n
  │ 		      collect (upcase (char-to-string l))))
  │ 	    lettery))
  └────

  That produces:

  ┌────
  │ ("Lettery" "A comprehensive taxonomy of letters."
  │  (("Vowels" "You know what those are."
  │    ("A" "E" "I"))
  │   ("Consonants" "Well, if they aren't vowels..."
  │    ("B" "C" "D" "F" "G" "H" "J" "K" "L" "M" "N"))))
  └────

  Oops, we forgot the letters after N!  Let's add them, too:

  ┌────
  │ (taxy-plain
  │  (taxy-fill (reverse
  │ 	     (cl-loop for l from ?n to ?z
  │ 		      collect (upcase (char-to-string l))))
  │ 	    lettery))
  └────

  Which gives us:

  ┌────
  │ ("Lettery" "A comprehensive taxonomy of letters."
  │  (("Vowels" "You know what those are."
  │    ("O" "U" "A" "E" "I"))
  │   ("Consonants" "Well, if they aren't vowels..."
  │    ("N" "P" "Q" "R" "S" "T" "V" "W" "X" "Y" "Z" "B" "C" "D" "F" "G" "H" "J" "K" "L" "M" "N"))))
  └────

  Oh, they're out of order, now.  That won't do.  Let's fix that:

  ┌────
  │ (taxy-plain
  │  (taxy-sort #'string< #'identity lettery))
  └────

  That's better:

  ┌────
  │ ("Lettery" "A comprehensive taxonomy of letters."
  │  (("Vowels" "You know what those are."
  │    ("A" "E" "I" "O" "U"))
  │   ("Consonants" "Well, if they aren't vowels..."
  │    ("B" "C" "D" "F" "G" "H" "J" "K" "L" "M" "N" "N" "P" "Q" "R" "S" "T" "V" "W" "X" "Y" "Z"))))
  └────


1.3 Sporty (understanding completely)
─────────────────────────────────────

  Let's try to understand a few things about sports.  First we'll define
  a struct to make them easier to grasp:

  ┌────
  │ (cl-defstruct sport
  │   name uses venue fun)
  └────

  Now we'll make a list of sports:

  ┌────
  │ (defvar sports
  │   (list (make-sport :name "Baseball"
  │ 		    :uses '(bat ball glove)
  │ 		    :venue 'outdoor
  │ 		    :fun t)
  │ 	(make-sport :name "Football"
  │ 		    :uses '(ball)
  │ 		    :venue 'outdoor
  │ 		    :fun t)
  │ 	(make-sport :name "Basketball"
  │ 		    :uses '(ball hoop)
  │ 		    :venue 'indoor
  │ 		    :fun t)
  │ 	(make-sport :name "Tennis"
  │ 		    :uses '(ball racket)
  │ 		    :venue 'outdoor
  │ 		    :fun t)
  │ 	(make-sport :name "Racquetball"
  │ 		    :uses '(ball racket)
  │ 		    :venue 'indoor
  │ 		    :fun t)
  │ 	(make-sport :name "Handball"
  │ 		    :uses '(ball glove)
  │ 		    :venue 'indoor
  │ 		    :fun t)
  │ 	(make-sport :name "Soccer"
  │ 		    :uses '(ball)
  │ 		    :venue 'outdoor
  │ 		    :fun nil)
  │ 	(make-sport :name "Disc golf"
  │ 		    :uses '(disc basket)
  │ 		    :venue 'outdoor
  │ 		    :fun t)
  │ 	(make-sport :name "Ultimate"
  │ 		    :uses '(disc)
  │ 		    :venue 'outdoor
  │ 		    :fun t)
  │ 	(make-sport :name "Volleyball"
  │ 		    :uses '(ball)
  │ 		    :venue 'indoor
  │ 		    :fun t)))
  └────

  And finally we'll define a taxy to organize them.  In this, we use a
  helper macro to make the `member' function easier to use in the list
  of key functions:

  ┌────
  │ (defvar sporty
  │   (cl-macrolet ((in (needle haystack)
  │ 		    `(lambda (item)
  │ 		       (when (member ,needle (funcall ,haystack item))
  │ 			 ,needle))))
  │     (make-taxy
  │      :name "Sporty"
  │      :take (lambda (item taxy)
  │ 	     (taxy-take-keyed
  │ 	       (list #'sport-venue
  │ 		     (in 'ball 'sport-uses)
  │ 		     (in 'disc 'sport-uses)
  │ 		     (in 'glove 'sport-uses)
  │ 		     (in 'racket 'sport-uses))
  │ 	       item taxy
  │ 	       ;; We set the `:then' function of the taxys
  │ 	       ;; created by `taxy-take-keyed' to `identity'
  │ 	       ;; so they will not consume their items.
  │ 	       :then #'identity)))))
  └────

  Now let's fill the taxy with the sports and format it:

  ┌────
  │ (thread-last sporty
  │   taxy-emptied
  │   (taxy-fill sports)
  │   (taxy-mapcar #'sport-name)
  │   taxy-plain)
  └────

  ┌────
  │ ((("Sporty"
  │    ((indoor
  │      ((ball
  │        ("Volleyball" "Basketball")
  │        ((glove
  │ 	 ("Handball"))
  │ 	(racket
  │ 	 ("Racquetball"))))))
  │     (outdoor
  │      ((disc
  │        ("Ultimate" "Disc golf"))
  │       (ball
  │        ("Soccer" "Football")
  │        ((racket
  │ 	 ("Tennis"))
  │ 	(glove
  │ 	 ("Baseball"))))))))))
  └────

  That's pretty sporty.  But classifying them by venue first makes the
  racket and glove sports not be listed together.  Let's swap the key
  functions around so the venue is classified at the deepest level of
  the hierarchy:

  ┌────
  │ (defvar sporty
  │   (cl-macrolet ((in (needle haystack)
  │ 		    `(lambda (item)
  │ 		       (when (member ,needle (funcall ,haystack item))
  │ 			 ,needle))))
  │     (make-taxy
  │      :name "Sporty"
  │      :take (lambda (item taxy)
  │ 	     (taxy-take-keyed
  │ 	       (list (in 'ball 'sport-uses)
  │ 		     (in 'disc 'sport-uses)
  │ 		     (in 'glove 'sport-uses)
  │ 		     (in 'racket 'sport-uses)
  │ 		     #'sport-venue)
  │ 	       item taxy
  │ 	       :then #'identity)))))
  │ 
  │ (thread-last sporty
  │   taxy-emptied
  │   (taxy-fill sports)
  │   (taxy-mapcar #'sport-name)
  │   taxy-plain)
  └────

  ┌────
  │ ((("Sporty"
  │    ((disc
  │      ((outdoor
  │        ("Ultimate" "Disc golf"))))
  │     (ball
  │      ((racket
  │        ((indoor
  │ 	 ("Racquetball"))
  │ 	(outdoor
  │ 	 ("Tennis"))))
  │       (indoor
  │        ("Volleyball" "Basketball"))
  │       (outdoor
  │        ("Soccer" "Football"))
  │       (glove
  │        ((indoor
  │ 	 ("Handball"))
  │ 	(outdoor
  │ 	 ("Baseball"))))))))))
  └────

  That's better.  But I'd also like to see a very simple classification
  to help me decide what to play:

  ┌────
  │ (thread-last
  │     (make-taxy
  │      :name "Funny"
  │      :take (lambda (item taxy)
  │ 	     (taxy-take-keyed
  │ 	       (list (lambda (sport)
  │ 		       (if (sport-fun sport)
  │ 			   'fun 'boring))
  │ 		     #'sport-venue)
  │ 	       item taxy)))
  │   taxy-emptied
  │   (taxy-fill sports)
  │   (taxy-mapcar #'sport-name)
  │   taxy-plain)
  └────

  ┌────
  │ ((("Funny"
  │    ((boring
  │      ((outdoor
  │        ("Soccer"))))
  │     (fun
  │      ((indoor
  │        ("Volleyball" "Handball" "Racquetball" "Basketball"))
  │       (outdoor
  │        ("Ultimate" "Disc golf" "Tennis" "Football" "Baseball"))))))))
  └────

  Ah, now I understand.

2 Installation
══════════════

  `taxy' is distributed in [GNU ELPA], which is available in Emacs by
  default.  Use `M-x package-install RET taxy RET', then `(require
  'taxy)' in your Elisp project.


[GNU ELPA] <https://elpa.gnu.org/>


3 Usage
═══════

  • 
  • 
  • 
  • 
  • 
  • 

  A taxy is defined with the `make-taxy' constructor, like:

  ┌────
  │ (make-taxy :name "Numbery"
  │ 	   :description "A silly taxonomy of numbers."
  │ 	   :predicate #'numberp
  │ 	   :then #'ignore
  │ 	   :taxys (list ...))
  └────

  The `:predicate' function determines whether an object fits into that
  taxy.  If it does, `taxy-fill' adds the object to that taxy's
  descendant `:taxys', if present, or to its own `:items'.  The function
  defaults to `identity', so a taxy "takes in" any object by default
  (i.e. if you only apply objects you want to classify, there's no need
  to test them at the top-level taxy).

  The `:then' function determines what happens to an object after being
  taken in to the taxy's `:items': if the function, called with the
  object, returns a non-nil value, that value is applied to other taxys
  at the same level until one of their `:then' functions returns nil or
  no more taxys remain.  The function defaults to `ignore', which makes
  a taxy "consume" its items by default.  Setting the function to,
  e.g. `identity', makes it not consume them, leaving them eligible to
  also be taken into subsequent taxys, or to appear in the parent taxy's
  items.

  After defining a taxy, call `taxy-fill' with it and a list of objects
  to fill the taxy's hierarchy.  *Note:* `taxy-fill' modifies the taxy
  given to it (filling its `:items' and those of its `:taxys'), so when
  using a statically defined taxy (e.g. one defined with `defvar'), you
  should pass `taxy-fill' a taxy copied with `taxy-emptied', which
  recursively copies a taxy without `:items'.

  To return a taxy in a more human-readable format (with only relevant
  fields included), use `taxy-plain'.  You may also use `taxy-mapcar' to
  replace items in a taxy with, e.g. a more useful representation.


3.1 Reusable taxys
──────────────────

  Since taxys are structs, they may be stored in variables and used in
  other structs (being sure to copy the root taxy with `taxy-emptied'
  before filling).  For example, this shows using `taxy' to classify
  Matrix rooms in [Ement.el]:

  ┌────
  │ (defun ement-roomy-buffer (room)
  │   (alist-get 'buffer (ement-room-local room)))
  │ 
  │ (defvar ement-roomy-unread
  │   (make-taxy :name "Unread"
  │ 	     :predicate (lambda (room)
  │ 			  (buffer-modified-p (ement-roomy-buffer room)))))
  │ 
  │ (defvar ement-roomy-opened
  │   (make-taxy :name "Opened"
  │ 	     :description "Rooms with buffers"
  │ 	     :predicate #'ement-roomy-buffer
  │ 	     :taxys (list ement-roomy-unread
  │ 			  (make-taxy))))
  │ 
  │ (defvar ement-roomy-closed
  │   (make-taxy :name "Closed"
  │ 	     :description "Rooms without buffers"
  │ 	     :predicate (lambda (room)
  │ 			  (not (ement-roomy-buffer room)))))
  │ 
  │ (defvar ement-roomy
  │   (make-taxy
  │    :name "Ement Rooms"
  │    :taxys (list (make-taxy
  │ 		 :name "Direct"
  │ 		 :description "Direct messaging rooms"
  │ 		 :predicate (lambda (room)
  │ 			      (ement-room--direct-p room ement-session))
  │ 		 :taxys (list ement-roomy-opened
  │ 			      ement-roomy-closed))
  │ 		(make-taxy
  │ 		 :name "Non-direct"
  │ 		 :description "Group chat rooms"
  │ 		 :taxys (list ement-roomy-opened
  │ 			      ement-roomy-closed)))))
  └────

  Note how the taxys defined in the first three variables are used in
  subsequent taxys.  As well, the `ement-roomy-opened' taxy has an
  "anonymous" taxy, which collects any rooms that aren't collected by
  its sibling taxy (otherwise those objects would be collected into the
  parent, "Opened" taxy, which may not always be the most useful way to
  present the objects).

  Using those defined taxys, we then fill the `ement-roomy' taxy with
  all of the rooms in the user's session, and then use `taxy-mapcar' to
  replace the room structs with useful representations for display:

  ┌────
  │ (taxy-plain
  │  (taxy-mapcar (lambda (room)
  │ 		(list (ement-room--room-display-name room)
  │ 		      (ement-room-id room)))
  │    (taxy-fill (ement-session-rooms ement-session)
  │ 	      (taxy-emptied ement-roomy))))
  └────

  This produces:

  ┌────
  │ ("Ement Rooms"
  │  (("Direct" "Direct messaging rooms"
  │    (("Opened" "Rooms with buffers"

3.2 Threading macros
────────────────────

  If you happen to like macros, `taxy' works well with threading
  (i.e. `thread-last' or `->>'):

  ┌────
  │ (thread-last ement-roomy
  │   taxy-emptied
  │   (taxy-fill (ement-session-rooms ement-session))
  │   (taxy-mapcar (lambda (room)
  │ 		 (list (ement-room--room-display-name room)
  │ 		       (ement-room-id room))))
  │   taxy-plain)
  └────


3.3 Modifying filled taxys
──────────────────────────

  Sometimes it's necessary to modify a taxy after filling it with
  objects, e.g. to sort the items and/or the sub-taxys.  For this, use
  the function `taxy-mapc-taxys' (a.k.a. `taxy-mapc*').  For example, in
  the sample application [musicy.el], the taxys and their items are
  sorted after filling, like so:

  ┌────
  │ (defun musicy-files (files)
  │   (thread-last musicy-taxy
  │     taxy-emptied
  │     (taxy-fill files)
  │     ;; Sort sub-taxys by their name.
  │     (taxy-sort* #'string< #'taxy-name)
  │     ;; Sort sub-taxys' items by name.
  │     (taxy-sort #'string< #'identity)
  │     taxy-magit-section-pp))
  └────

3.4 Dynamic taxys
─────────────────

  • 
  • 
  • 

  You may not always know in advance what taxonomy a set of objects fits
  into, so `taxy' lets you add taxys dynamically by using the `:take'
  function to add a taxy when an object is "taken into" a parent taxy's
  items.  For example, you could dynamically classify buffers by their
  major mode like so:

  ┌────
  │ (defun buffery-major-mode (buffer)
  │   (buffer-local-value 'major-mode buffer))
  │ 
  │ (defvar buffery
  │   (make-taxy
  │    :name "Buffers"
  │    :taxys (list
  │ 	   (make-taxy
  │ 	    :name "Modes"
  │ 	    :take (apply-partially #'taxy-take-keyed (list #'buffery-major-mode))))))
  │ 
  │ ;; Note the use of `taxy-emptied' to avoid mutating the original taxy definition.
  │ (taxy-plain
  │  (taxy-fill (buffer-list)
  │ 	    (taxy-emptied buffery)))
  └────

  The taxy's `:take' function is set to the `taxy-take-keyed' function,
  partially applied with the `buffery-major-mode' function as its list
  of `key-fns' (`taxy-fill' supplies the buffer and the taxy as
  arguments), and it produces this taxonomy of buffers:

  ┌────
  │ ("Buffers"
  │  (("Modes"
  │    ((magit-process-mode
  │      (#<buffer magit-process: taxy.el> #<buffer magit-process: > #<buffer magit-process: notes>))
  │     (messages-buffer-mode
  │      (#<buffer *Messages*>))
  │     (special-mode
  │      (#<buffer *Warnings*> #<buffer *elfeed-log*>))
  │     (dired-mode
  │      (#<buffer ement.el<emacs>>))
  │     (Custom-mode
  │      (#<buffer *Customize Apropos*>))
  │     (fundamental-mode
  │      (#<buffer  *helm candidates:Bookmarks*> #<buffer *Backtrace*>))
  │     (magit-diff-mode
  │      (#<buffer magit-diff: taxy.el> #<buffer magit-diff: notes> #<buffer magit-diff: ement.el>))
  │     (compilation-mode
  │      (#<buffer *compilation*> #<buffer *Compile-Log*>))
  │     (Info-mode
  │      (#<buffer  *helm info temp buffer*> #<buffer *info*>))
  │     (help-mode
  │      (#<buffer *Help*>))
  │     (emacs-lisp-mode
  │      (#<buffer ement.el<ement.el>> #<buffer ement-room-list.el> #<buffer *scratch*>
  │ 	       #<buffer ement-room.el> #<buffer init.el> #<buffer bufler.el>
  │ 	       #<buffer dash.el> #<buffer *Pp Eval Output*> #<buffer taxy.el> #<buffer scratch.el>))))))
  └────


3.4.1 Multi-level dynamic taxys
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Of course, the point of taxonomies is that they aren't restricted to a
  single level of depth, so you may also use the function
  `taxy-take-keyed' to dynamically make multi-level taxys.

  Expanding on the previous example, we use `cl-labels' to define
  functions which are used in the taxy's definition, which are used in
  the `:take' function, which calls `taxy-take-keyed' (rather than using
  `apply-partially' like in the previous example, we use a lambda
  function, which performs better than partially applied functions).
  Then when the taxy is filled, a multi-level hierarchy is created
  dynamically, organizing buffers first by their directory, and then by
  mode in each directory.

  ┌────
  │ (defvar buffery
  │   (cl-labels ((buffer-mode (buffer) (buffer-local-value 'major-mode buffer))
  │ 	      (buffer-directory (buffer) (buffer-local-value 'default-directory buffer)))
  │     (make-taxy
  │      :name "Buffers"
  │      :taxys (list
  │ 	     (make-taxy
  │ 	      :name "Directories"
  │ 	      :take (lambda (item taxy)
  │ 		      (taxy-take-keyed (list #'buffer-directory #'buffer-mode) item taxy)))))))
  │ 
  │ (taxy-plain
  │  (taxy-fill (buffer-list)
  │ 	    (taxy-emptied buffery)))
  └────

  That produces a list like:

  ┌────
  │ ("Buffers"
  │  (("Directories"
  │    (("~/src/emacs/ement.el/"
  │      ((dired-mode
  │        (#<buffer ement.el<emacs>))
  │       (emacs-lisp-mode
  │        (#<buffer ement.el<ement.el> #<buffer ement-room-list.el> #<buffer ement-room.el>))
  │       (magit-diff-mode
  │        (#<buffer magit-diff: ement.el>))))
  │     ("~/src/emacs/taxy.el/"
  │      ((dired-mode
  │        (#<buffer taxy.el<emacs>))
  │       (Info-mode
  │        (#<buffer *info*>))
  │       (magit-status-mode
  │        (#<buffer magit: taxy.el>))
  │       (emacs-lisp-mode
  │        (#<buffer taxy-magit-section.el> #<buffer taxy.el<taxy.el> #<buffer scratch.el>))))))))
  └────


3.4.2 "Chains" of independent, multi-level dynamic taxys
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  /Naming things is hard./

  Going a step further, each element in the `taxy-take-keyed' function's
  `KEY-FNS' argument may be a list of functions (or a list of lists of
  functions, etc.), which creates a "chain" of "independent" dynamic
  taxys.  Each such chain may be said to "short-circuit" the filling
  process in that, when an object is "taken" by the first key function
  in a chain, the object is not "offered" to other functions outside
  that chain.  This allows each dynamic sub-taxy to have its own set of
  sub-taxys, rather than sharing the same "global" set.  In effect, this
  creates multiple, unique taxonomies that share a single root taxy.

  Building on the `sporty' example, let's define a taxy in which outdoor
  sports are classified only by whether they involve a disc, but indoor
  sports are additionally classified by whatever equipment they may use:

  ┌────
  │ (defvar sporty-dynamic
  │   (cl-macrolet ((in (needle haystack)
  │ 		    `(lambda (item)
  │ 		       (when (member ,needle (funcall ,haystack item))
  │ 			 ,needle))))
  │     (cl-labels ((outdoor-p
  │ 		 (sport) (when (eq 'outdoor (sport-venue sport))
  │ 			   "Outdoor"))
  │ 		(indoor-p
  │ 		 (sport) (when (eq 'indoor (sport-venue sport))
  │ 			   "Indoor"))
  │ 		(disc-p
  │ 		 (sport) (if (funcall (in 'disc 'sport-uses) sport)
  │ 			     'disc
  │ 			   'non-disc)))
  │       (make-taxy
  │        :name "Sporty (dynamic)"
  │        :take (lambda (item taxy)
  │ 	       (taxy-take-keyed
  │ 		 (list (list #'outdoor-p #'disc-p)
  │ 		       (list #'indoor-p
  │ 			     (in 'ball 'sport-uses)
  │ 			     (in 'disc 'sport-uses)
  │ 			     (in 'glove 'sport-uses)
  │ 			     (in 'racket 'sport-uses)))
  │ 		 item taxy))))))
  └────

  Now let's fill the taxy with the sports and format it:

  ┌────
  │ (thread-last sporty-dynamic
  │   taxy-emptied
  │   (taxy-fill sports)
  │   (taxy-mapcar #'sport-name)
  │   taxy-plain)
  └────

  ┌────
  │ ("Sporty (dynamic)"
  │  (("Indoor"
  │    ((ball
  │      ("Volleyball" "Basketball")
  │      ((glove
  │        ("Handball"))
  │       (racket
  │        ("Racquetball"))))))
  │   ("Outdoor"
  │    ((disc
  │      ("Ultimate" "Disc golf"))
  │     (non-disc
  │      ("Soccer" "Tennis" "Football" "Baseball"))))))
  └────


3.4.3 Defining a classification domain-specific language
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  When writing a larger Taxy-based application, it may be necessary to
  define a number of key functions that would be unwieldy to manage in a
  `cl-labels' form.  For this case, Taxy provides the macro
  `taxy-define-key-definer' to easily define Taxy key functions in an
  application library.  Those functions are then passed to the function
  `taxy-make-take-function' at runtime, along with a list of keys being
  used to classify items.  Using these allows key functions to be
  defined in top-level forms, and it allows an application to be
  extended by users by defining additional key functions in their
  configurations.

  Extending the previous `sporty' example, let's redefine its key
  functions using `taxy-define-key-definer':

  ┌────
  │ (taxy-define-key-definer sporty-define-key
  │   sporty-keys "sporty"
  │   "Define a `sporty' key function.")
  │ 
  │ (sporty-define-key disc-based ()
  │   (if (member 'disc (sport-uses item))
  │       "Disc-based"
  │     "Non-disc-based"))
  │ 
  │ (sporty-define-key uses (&optional thing)
  │   (pcase thing
  │     (`nil (sport-uses item))
  │     (_ (when (cl-typecase (sport-uses item)
  │ 	       (symbol (equal thing (sport-uses item)))
  │ 	       (list (member thing (sport-uses item))))
  │ 	 thing))))
  │ 
  │ (sporty-define-key venue (&optional place)
  │   (pcase place
  │     (`nil (sport-venue item))
  │     (_ (when (equal place (sport-venue item))
  │ 	 (sport-venue item)))))
  └────

  Now we'll define the default keys to use when classifying items.  This
  list is equivalent to the one passed to `taxy-take-keyed' in the
  previous, "Chains" example.

  ┌────
  │ (defvar sporty-default-keys
  │   '(
  │     ((venue 'outdoor)
  │      disc-based)
  │ 
  │     ((venue 'indoor)
  │      (uses 'ball)
  │      (uses 'disc)
  │      (uses 'glove)
  │      (uses 'racket))))
  └────

  Finally, rather than using a pre-made taxy struct, we make one at
  runtime, making the `:take' function with `taxy-make-take-function'.

  ┌────
  │ (let ((taxy (make-taxy
  │ 	     :name "Sporty (DSL)"
  │ 	     :take (taxy-make-take-function sporty-default-keys
  │ 					    sporty-keys))))
  │   (thread-last taxy
  │     (taxy-fill sports)
  │     (taxy-mapcar #'sport-name)
  │     taxy-plain))
  └────

  Which gives us:

  ┌────
  │ ("Sporty (DSL)"
  │  ((indoor
  │    ((ball
  │      ("Volleyball" "Basketball")
  │      ((glove
  │        ("Handball"))
  │       (racket
  │        ("Racquetball"))))))
  │   (outdoor
  │    (("Disc-based"
  │      ("Ultimate" "Disc golf"))
  │     ("Non-disc-based"
  │      ("Soccer" "Tennis" "Football" "Baseball"))))))
  └────

  As you can see, the result is the same as that in the previous
  example, but we've defined a kind of DSL for grouping sports in a
  modular, extendable way.

  This also allows the grouping keys to be easily changed at runtime,
  producing a different result.  For example, we could group sports by,
  first, whether they use a ball, and then by venue.  Let's do this in a
  function so that users can pass their own list of keys:

  ┌────
  │ (cl-defun sporty-classify (sports &key (keys sporty-default-keys))
  │   (declare (indent defun))
  │   (let* ((taxy (make-taxy
  │ 		:name "Sporty (DSL)"
  │ 		:take (taxy-make-take-function keys
  │ 					       sporty-keys))))
  │     (thread-last taxy
  │       (taxy-fill sports)
  │       (taxy-mapcar #'sport-name)
  │       taxy-plain)))
  │ 
  │ (sporty-classify sports
  │   :keys '((uses 'ball) venue))
  └────

  And this produces:

  ┌────
  │ ("Sporty (DSL)"
  │  ((outdoor
  │    ("Ultimate" "Disc golf"))
  │   (ball
  │    ((indoor
  │      ("Volleyball" "Handball" "Racquetball" "Basketball"))
  │     (outdoor
  │      ("Soccer" "Tennis" "Football" "Baseball"))))))
  └────


3.5 Magit section
─────────────────

  Showing a `taxy' with `magit-section' is easy using the library
  [taxy-magit-section], which is packaged separately:

  ┌────
  │ (require 'taxy-magit-section)
  │ 
  │ ;; Using the `numbery' taxy defined in earlier examples:
  │ (thread-last numbery
  │   taxy-emptied ;; Get an empty copy of the taxy, since it's defined in a variable.
  │   (taxy-fill (reverse (cl-loop for i below 30 collect i)))
  │   taxy-magit-section-pp)
  └────

  That shows a buffer like this:

3.6.1 Functions
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  taxy-flatten (taxy)
        Return a list of items in `taxy' and its sub-taxys.

  taxy-emptied (taxy)
        Return a copy of `taxy' without items.  Omits =taxy=’s items and
        those of its descendant taxys.  Useful when reusing taxy
        definitions.

  taxy-fill (items taxy)
        Fill `taxy' with `items' according to its definition.

  taxy-make-take-function (keys aliases)
        Return a taxy "take" function for `keys'.  Each of `keys' should
        be a function alias defined in `aliases', or a list of such
        `key-fns' (recursively, ad infinitum, approximately).  `aliases'
        should be an alist mapping aliases to functions (such as defined
        with a definer defined by `taxy-define-key-definer').

  taxy-mapc-taxys (fn taxy)
        *Alias:* `taxy-mapc*'

        Return `taxy' having applied `fn' to it and its descendants.
        Does not copy `taxy'.  Destructively modifies `taxy', if `fn'
        does.

  taxy-mapcar-items (fn taxy)
        *Alias:* `taxy-mapcar'

        Return copy of `taxy', having replaced its items with the value
        of `fn' on each.  Replaces every item in `taxy' and its
        descendants.  Useful to replace items with a more useful form
        after classification.

  taxy-plain (taxy)
        Return a list of the human-readable parts of `taxy'.

  taxy-size (taxy)
        Return the number of items `taxy' holds.  Includes items in
        `taxy' ’s sub-taxys.

  taxy-sort-items (pred key taxy)
        *Alias:* `taxy-sort'

        Sort `taxy' ’s items by `pred' and `key'.  Sorts items in `taxy'
        and its sub-taxys.  `key' is passed to `cl-sort', which see.

  taxy-sort-taxys (pred key taxy)
        *Alias:* `taxy-sort*'

        Sort `taxy' ’s sub-taxys by `pred' and `key'.  `key' is passed
        to `cl-sort', which see.


3.6.2 Macros
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  taxy-define-key-definer (name variable prefix docstring)
        Define a macro `name' that defines a key-function-defining
        macro.  The defined macro, having string `docstring', associates
        the defined key functions with their aliases in an alist stored
        in symbol `variable'.  The defined key functions are named
        having string `prefix', which will have a hyphen appended to it.
        The key functions take one or more arguments, the first of which
        is the item being tested, bound within the function to `item'.

4.7 0.5
───────

4.7.1 Additions
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ⁃ Function `taxy-magit-section-insert' takes new arguments:
    • `:initial-depth' sets the level at which the first level of
      hierarchy is considered to be at, for purposes of indentation.
      Setting it to a negative number prevents indentation of so many
      levels (i.e. setting it to -1 causes the first two levels to be
      unindented, since the first level will be considered to be at
      depth -1, and the second at depth 0).
    • `:blank-between-depth' sets the level up to which blank lines
      are inserted between sections (i.e. setting it to 1 causes blank
      lines to be inserted between sections up to depth 1, but not
      between sections deeper than that).
  ⁃ Struct `taxy-magit-section' has a new `heading-face' slot, a
    function which takes a depth level argument and returns the face
    with which to propertize that section's heading.
  ⁃ New example `taxy-package-report'.


4.7.2 Fixes
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ⁃ Example `diredy' referred to an old function name.


4.8 0.4
───────

  ⁃ Incremented version to cause a new ELPA release (since removing a
    file that wasn't intended to be distributed on ELPA).


4.9 0.3
───────

4.9.1 Changes
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ⁃ Within the `taxy' struct and related functions, the term `objects'
    is renamed to `items', which is shorter and has the same meaning.
    This makes code a bit more concise (e.g. `(taxy-objects taxy)'
    becomes `(taxy-items taxy)').


4.9.2 Fixes
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ⁃ Function `taxy-fill' always calls a taxy's `:take' function if
    defined.  (Fixing "chains" of dynamic taxys.)
  ⁃ Function `taxy-magit-section-insert' applies text properties from
    the inserted string to the indentation string (so commands that
    rely on text properties at the beginning of a line will work).

4.10.1 Changes
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ⁃ Function `taxy-take-keyed*' is renamed to `taxy-take-keyed',
    replacing the old function: it's more powerful, and there's little
    reason to maintain two versions.


4.10.2 Additions
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ⁃ Struct `taxy' now has a `:make' slot, a function called to make new
    sub-taxys by `take-take-keyed' (defaulting to `make-taxy').  This
    is useful when defining structs specialized on `taxy'.
  ⁃ Struct `taxy-magit-section' now has an `:indent' slot, a number of
    characters by which to indent each level of sub-taxy, applied
    automatically by function `taxy-magit-section-insert'.
  ⁃ Each element of the new `taxy-take-keyed''s `KEY-FNS' argument may
    now be a function or a list of functions (or a list of a list of
    functions, etc.).  Lists of functions create "chains" of
    independent, dynamic taxys descending from a single root taxy.  See
    .


4.10.3 Fixes
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ⁃ `taxy-magit-section''s `insert-object' function.
  ⁃ `taxy-fill' now applies objects to the root taxy if no sub-taxys
    take them.
