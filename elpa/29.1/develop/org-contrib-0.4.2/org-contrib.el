;;; Commentary

;; This package contains add-ons to Org-mode which are not part of GNU
;; Emacs or of the official Org package.

;; ** This package receive little if no maintainance. **

;; Especially, there is no guaranty that it is compatible with the latest
;; Org stable version.  Would you would like to volunteer maintaining it?
;; If so, please send me an email at bzg@gnu.org.

;; If you want to maintain only one or some of these add-ons please send
;; me an email and consider hosting the add-ons on a separate repository.

;; These files used to live in the Org repository but have been filtered
;; out of the Org 9.5 release and are stored here for archival purpose.
;; The contrib/ directory used to contain a scripts/ directory that now
;; lives on Worg: <https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/worg/src/master/code>.

;;; Note:

;; This file, org-contrib.el, provides metadata for the (future)
;; org-contrib GNU ELPA package.

;;; Code:

(provide 'org-contrib)

;;; org-contrib.el ends here
