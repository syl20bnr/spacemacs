;;; Commentary:

;; This package assists the user in writing good Git commit messages.

;; While Git allows for the message to be provided on the command
;; line, it is preferable to tell Git to create the commit without
;; actually passing it a message.  Git then invokes the `$GIT_EDITOR'
;; (or if that is undefined `$EDITOR') asking the user to provide the
;; message by editing the file ".git/COMMIT_EDITMSG" (or another file
;; in that directory, e.g., ".git/MERGE_MSG" for merge commits).

;; When `global-git-commit-mode' is enabled, which it is by default,
;; then opening such a file causes the features described below, to
;; be enabled in that buffer.  Normally this would be done using a
;; major-mode but to allow the use of any major-mode, as the user sees
;; fit, it is done here by running a setup function, which among other
;; things turns on the preferred major-mode, by default `text-mode'.

;; Git waits for the `$EDITOR' to finish and then either creates the
;; commit using the contents of the file as commit message, or, if the
;; editor process exited with a non-zero exit status, aborts without
;; creating a commit.  Unfortunately Emacsclient (which is what Emacs
;; users should be using as `$EDITOR' or at least as `$GIT_EDITOR')
;; does not differentiate between "successfully" editing a file and
;; aborting; not out of the box that is.

;; By making use of the `with-editor' package this package provides
;; both ways of finish an editing session.  In either case the file
;; is saved, but Emacseditor's exit code differs.
;;
;;   C-c C-c  Finish the editing session successfully by returning
;;            with exit code 0.  Git then creates the commit using
;;            the message it finds in the file.
;;
;;   C-c C-k  Aborts the edit editing session by returning with exit
;;            code 1.  Git then aborts the commit.

;; Aborting the commit does not cause the message to be lost, but
;; relying solely on the file not being tampered with is risky.  This
;; package additionally stores all aborted messages for the duration
;; of the current session (i.e., until you close Emacs).  To get back
;; an aborted message use M-p and M-n while editing a message.
;;
;;   M-p      Replace the buffer contents with the previous message
;;            from the message ring.  Of course only after storing
;;            the current content there too.
;;
;;   M-n      Replace the buffer contents with the next message from
;;            the message ring, after storing the current content.

;; Support for inserting Git trailers (as described in the manpage
;; git-interpret-trailers(1)) is available.
;;
;;   C-c C-i  Insert a trailer selected from a transient menu.

;; When Git requests a commit message from the user, it does so by
;; having her edit a file which initially contains some comments,
;; instructing her what to do, and providing useful information, such
;; as which files were modified.  These comments, even when left
;; intact by the user, do not become part of the commit message.  This
;; package ensures these comments are propertizes as such and further
;; prettifies them by using different faces for various parts, such as
;; files.

;; Finally this package highlights style errors, like lines that are
;; too long, or when the second line is not empty.  It may even nag
;; you when you attempt to finish the commit without having fixed
;; these issues.  The style checks and many other settings can easily
;; be configured:
;;
;;   M-x customize-group RET git-commit RET
