;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  This package provide the `async-byte-recompile-directory' function
;;  which allows, as the name says to recompile a directory outside of
;;  your running emacs.
;;  The benefit is your files will be compiled in a clean environment without
;;  the old *.el files loaded.
;;  Among other things, this fix a bug in package.el which recompile
;;  the new files in the current environment with the old files loaded, creating
;;  errors in most packages after upgrades.
;;
;;  NB: This package is advicing the function `package--compile'.
