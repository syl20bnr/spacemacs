;;; Commentary:

;; Ghub provides basic support for using the APIs of various Git forges
;; from Emacs packages.  Originally it only supported the Github REST
;; API, but now it also supports the Github GraphQL API as well as the
;; REST APIs of Gitlab, Gitea, Gogs and Bitbucket.

;; Ghub abstracts access to API resources using only a handful of basic
;; functions such as `ghub-get'.  These are convenience wrappers around
;; `ghub-request'.  Additional forge-specific wrappers like `glab-put',
;; `gtea-put', `gogs-post' and `buck-delete' are also available.  Ghub
;; does not provide any resource-specific functions, with the exception
;; of `FORGE-repository-id'.

;; When accessing Github, then Ghub handles the creation and storage of
;; access tokens using a setup wizard to make it easier for users to get
;; started.  The tokens for other forges have to be created manually.

;; Ghub is intentionally limited to only provide these two essential
;; features — basic request functions and guided setup — to avoid being
;; too opinionated, which would hinder wide adoption.  It is assumed that
;; wide adoption would make life easier for users and maintainers alike,
;; because then all packages that talk to forge APIs could be configured
;; the same way.

;; Please consult the manual (info "ghub") for more information.

  "Make a request for RESOURCE and return the response body.

Also place the response headers in `ghub-response-headers'.

METHOD is the HTTP method, given as a string.
RESOURCE is the resource to access, given as a string beginning
  with a slash.

PARAMS, QUERY, PAYLOAD and HEADERS are alists used to specify
  data.  The Github API documentation is vague on how data has
  to be transmitted and for a particular resource usually just
  talks about \"parameters\".  Generally speaking when the METHOD
  is \"HEAD\" or \"GET\", then they have to be transmitted as a
  query, otherwise as a payload.
Use PARAMS to automatically transmit like QUERY or PAYLOAD would
  depending on METHOD.
Use QUERY to explicitly transmit data as a query.
Use PAYLOAD to explicitly transmit data as a payload.
  Instead of an alist, PAYLOAD may also be a string, in which
  case it gets encoded as UTF-8 but is otherwise transmitted as-is.
Use HEADERS for those rare resources that require that the data
  is transmitted as headers instead of as a query or payload.
  When that is the case, then the API documentation usually
  mentions it explicitly.

If SILENT is non-nil, then don't message progress reports and
  the like.

If UNPAGINATE is t, then make as many requests as necessary to
  get all values.  If UNPAGINATE is a natural number, then get
  at most that many pages.  For any other non-nil value raise
  an error.
If NOERROR is non-nil, then do not raise an error if the request
  fails and return nil instead.  If NOERROR is `return', then
  return the error payload instead of nil.
If READER is non-nil, then it is used to read and return from the
  response buffer.  The default is `ghub--read-json-payload'.
  For the very few resources that do not return JSON, you might
  want to use `ghub--decode-payload'.

If USERNAME is non-nil, then make a request on behalf of that
  user.  It is better to specify the user using the Git variable
  `github.user' for \"api.github.com\", or `github.HOST.user' if
  connecting to a Github Enterprise instance.

Each package that uses `ghub' should use its own token.  If AUTH
  is nil, then the generic `ghub' token is used instead.  This
  is only acceptable for personal utilities.  A packages that
  is distributed to other users should always use this argument
  to identify itself, using a symbol matching its name.

  Package authors who find this inconvenient should write a
  wrapper around this function and possibly for the
  method-specific functions as well.

  Some symbols have a special meaning.  `none' means to make an
  unauthorized request.  `basic' means to make a password based
  request.  If the value is a string, then it is assumed to be
  a valid token.  `basic' and an explicit token string are only
  intended for internal and debugging uses.

If HOST is non-nil, then connect to that Github instance.  This
  defaults to \"api.github.com\".  When a repository is connected
  to a Github Enterprise instance, then it is better to specify
  that using the Git variable `github.host' instead of using this
  argument.

If FORGE is `gitlab', then connect to Gitlab.com or, depending
  on HOST, to another Gitlab instance.  This is only intended for
  internal use.  Instead of using this argument you should use
  function `glab-request' and other `glab-*' functions.

If CALLBACK and/or ERRORBACK is non-nil, then make one or more
  asynchronous requests and call CALLBACK or ERRORBACK when
  finished.  If no error occurred, then call CALLBACK, unless
  that is nil.

  If an error occurred, then call ERRORBACK, or if that is nil,
  then CALLBACK.  ERRORBACK can also be t, in which case an error
  is signaled instead.  NOERROR is ignored for all asynchronous
  requests.

Both callbacks are called with four arguments.
  1. For CALLBACK, the combined value of the retrieved pages.
     For ERRORBACK, the error that occurred when retrieving the
     last page.
  2. The headers of the last page as an alist.
  3. Status information provided by `url-retrieve'. Its `:error'
     property holds the same information as ERRORBACK's first
     argument.
  4. A `ghub--req' struct, which can be passed to `ghub-continue'
     (which see) to retrieve the next page, if any."
