;;; Commentary:

;; Evil is defined as a globalized minor mode, enabled with the toggle
;; function `evil-mode'.  This in turn enables `evil-local-mode' in
;; every buffer, which sets up the buffer's state.
;;
;; Each state has its own keymaps, and these keymaps have status as
;; "emulation keymaps" with priority over regular keymaps.  Emacs
;; maintains the following keymap hierarchy (highest priority first):
;;
;;     * Overriding keymaps/overlay keymaps...
;;     * Emulation mode keymaps...
;;       - Evil keymaps...
;;     * Minor mode keymaps...
;;     * Local keymap (`local-set-key')
;;     * Global keymap (`global-set-key')
;;
;; Within this hierarchy, Evil arranges the keymaps for the current
;; state as shown below:
;;
;;     * Intercept keymaps...
;;     * Local state keymap
;;     * Minor-mode keymaps...
;;     * Auxiliary keymaps...
;;     * Overriding keymaps...
;;     * Global state keymap
;;     * Keymaps for other states...
;;
;; These keymaps are listed in `evil-mode-map-alist', which is listed
;; in `emulation-mode-map-alist'.
;;
;; Most of the key bindings for a state are stored in its global
;; keymap, which has a name such as `evil-normal-state-map'. (See the
;; file evil-maps.el, which contains all the default key bindings.) A
;; state also has a local keymap (`evil-normal-state-local-map'),
;; which may contain user customizations for the current buffer.
;; Furthermore, any Emacs mode may be assigned state bindings of its
;; own by passing the mode's keymap to the function `evil-define-key'
;; or `evil-define-minor-mode-key'. The former uses a specific map to
;; define the key in while the latter associates the key with a
;; particular mode. These mode-specific bindings are ultimately stored
;; in so-called auxiliary and minor-mode keymaps respectively, which
;; are sandwiched between the local keymap and the global keymap.
;; Finally, the state may also activate the keymaps of other states
;; (e.g., Normal state inherits bindings from Motion state).
;;
;; For integration purposes, a regular Emacs keymap may be "elevated"
;; to emulation status by passing it to `evil-make-intercept-map' or
;; `evil-make-overriding-map'.  An "intercept" keymap has priority over
;; all other Evil keymaps.  (Evil uses this facility when debugging and
;; for handling the "ESC" key in the terminal.) More common is the
;; "overriding" keymap, which only has priority over the global state
;; keymap.  (This is useful for adapting key-heavy modes such as Dired,
;; where all but a few keys should be left as-is and should not be
;; shadowed by Evil's default bindings.)
;;
;; States are defined with the macro `evil-define-state', which
;; creates a command for switching to the state.  This command,
;; for example `evil-normal-state' for Normal state, performs
;; the following tasks:
;;
;;     * Setting `evil-state' to the new state.
;;     * Refreshing the keymaps in `evil-mode-map-alist'.
;;     * Updating the mode line.
;;       - Normal state depends on `evil-normal-state-tag'.
;;     * Adjusting the cursor's appearance.
;;       - Normal state depends on `evil-normal-state-cursor'.
;;     * Displaying a message in the echo area.
;;       - Normal state depends on `evil-normal-state-message'.
;;     * Running hooks.
;;       - Normal state runs `evil-normal-state-entry-hook' when
;;         entering, and `evil-normal-state-exit-hook' when exiting.
;;
;; The various properties of a state can be accessed through their
;; respective variables, or by passing a keyword and the state's name
;; to the `evil-state-property' function.  Evil defines the states
;; Normal state ("normal"), Insert state ("insert"), Visual state
;; ("visual"), Replace state ("replace"), Operator-Pending state
;; ("operator"), Motion state ("motion") and Emacs state ("emacs").

STATE is one of `normal', `insert', `visual', `replace',
`operator', `motion', `emacs', or a list of one or more of
these. Omitting a state by using `nil' corresponds to a standard
Emacs binding using `define-key'. The remaining arguments are
like those of `define-key'. For example:

    (evil-define-key \\='normal foo-map \"a\" \\='bar)

This creates a binding from `a' to `bar' in normal state, which
is active whenever `foo-map' is active. Using nil for the state,
the following lead to identical bindings:

    (evil-define-key nil foo-map \"a\" \\='bar)
    (define-key foo-map \"a\" \\='bar)

It is possible to specify multiple states and/or bindings at
once:

    (evil-define-key \\='(normal visual) foo-map
      \"a\" \\='bar
      \"b\" \\='foo)

If `foo-map' has not been initialized yet, this macro adds an
entry to `after-load-functions', delaying execution as necessary.

KEYMAP may also be a quoted symbol. If the symbol is `global', the
global evil keymap corresponding to the state(s) is used, meaning
the following lead to identical bindings:

    (evil-define-key \\='normal \\='global \"a\" \\='bar)
    (evil-global-set-key \\='normal \"a\" \\='bar)

The symbol `local' may also be used, which corresponds to using
`evil-local-set-key'. If a quoted symbol is used that is not
`global' or `local', it is assumed to be the name of a minor
mode, in which case `evil-define-minor-mode-key' is used."

(defun evil-define-key* (state keymap key def &rest bindings)
  "Create a STATE binding from KEY to DEF for KEYMAP.
STATE is one of normal, insert, visual, replace, operator,
motion, emacs, or a list of one or more of these. Omitting a
state by using nil corresponds to a standard Emacs binding using
`define-key' The remaining arguments are like those of
`define-key'. For example:

    (evil-define-key* \\='normal foo-map \"a\" \\='bar)

This creates a binding from \"a\" to bar in Normal state, which
is active whenever foo-map is active. Using nil for the state,
the following are equivalent:

    (evil-define-key* nil foo-map \"a\" \\='bar)

    (define-key foo-map \"a\" \\='bar)

 It is possible to specify multiple states and/or bindings at
 once:

    (evil-define-key* \\='(normal visual) foo-map
      \"a\" \\='bar
      \"b\" \\='foo)

KEYMAP may also be a quoted symbol. If the symbol is global, the
global evil keymap corresponding to the state(s) is used, meaning
the following are equivalent:

    (evil-define-key* \\='normal \\='global \"a\" \\='bar)

    (evil-global-set-key \\='normal \"a\" \\='bar)

The symbol local may also be used, which corresponds to using
`evil-local-set-key'.

The use is nearly identical to `evil-define-key' with the
exception that this is a function and not a macro (and so will
not be expanded when compiled which can have unintended
consequences). `evil-define-key*' also does not defer any
bindings like `evil-define-key' does using `evil-with-delay'.  This
allows errors in the bindings to be caught immediately, and makes
its behavior more predictable."

that the bindings can be created immediately, because this
