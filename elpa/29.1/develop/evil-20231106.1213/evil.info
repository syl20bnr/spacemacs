1 Overview
**********

Evil is an extensible vi layer for Emacs.  It emulates the main features
of Vim, (1) turning Emacs into a modal editor.  Like Emacs in general,
Evil is extensible in Emacs Lisp.

* Menu:

* Installation via package.el: Installation via package el.
* Manual installation::
* Modes and states::

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) (1) Vim is the most popular version of `vi', a modal text editor
with many implementations.  Vim also adds some functions of its own,
like visual selection and text objects.  For more information see the
official Vim website (https://www.vim.org).


File: evil.info,  Node: Installation via package el,  Next: Manual installation,  Up: Overview

1.1 Installation via package.el
===============================

Evil is available as a package from MELPA stable, MELPA unstable and
NonGNU ELPA. This is the recommended way of installing Evil.

To set up ‘package.el’ to work with one of the MELPA repositories, you
can follow the instructions on melpa.org(1).

Alternatively you can use NonGNU ELPA. It is part of the default package
archives as of Emacs 28.  For older Emacs versions you’ll need to add it
yourself:

     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  (cons "nongnu" (format "http%s://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/"
                                         (if (gnutls-available-p) "s" ""))))

Once that is done, you can execute the following commands:

     M-x package-refresh-contents
     M-x package-install RET evil RET

Finally, add the following lines to your Emacs init file:

     (require 'evil)
     (evil-mode 1)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

File: evil.info,  Node: Manual installation,  Next: Modes and states,  Prev: Installation via package el,  Up: Overview

1.2 Manual installation
=======================

First, install ‘goto-chg’ and ‘cl-lib’.  If you have an Emacs version of
24.3 or newer, you should already have ‘cl-lib’.

Evil lives in a git repository.  To download Evil, do:

     git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil.git

Then add the following lines to your Emacs init file:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/evil")
     (require 'evil)
     (evil-mode 1)

Ensure that your replace ‘path/to/evil’ with the actual path to where
you cloned Evil.


File: evil.info,  Node: Modes and states,  Prev: Manual installation,  Up: Overview

1.3 Modes and states
====================

The next time Emacs is started, it will come up in `normal state',
denoted by ‘<N>’ in the mode line.  This is where the main vi bindings
are defined.  Note that you can always disable normal state with ‘C-z’,
which switches to an “Emacs state” (denoted by ‘<E>’) in which vi keys
are completely disabled.  Press ‘C-z’ again to switch back to normal
state.

state

     Evil uses the term `state' for what is called a “mode” in regular
     vi usage, because `modes' are understood in Emacs terms to mean
     something else.

Evil defines a number of states by default:

normal state (‘<N>’)

     This is the default “resting state” of Evil, in which the main body
     of vi bindings are defined.

insert state (‘<I>’)

     This is the state for insertion of text, where non-modified keys
     will insert the corresponding character in the buffer.

visual state (‘<V>’)

     A state for selecting text regions.  Motions are available for
     modifying the selected region, and operators are available for
     acting on it.

replace state (‘<R>’)

     A special state mostly similar to insert state, except it replaces
     text instead of inserting.

operator-pending state (‘<O>’)

     A special state entered after launching an operator, but before
     specifying the corresponding motion or text object.

motion state (‘<M>’)

     A special state useful for buffers that are read-only, where
     motions are available but editing operations are not.

Emacs state (‘<E>’)

     A state that as closely as possible mimics default Emacs behaviour,
     by eliminating all vi bindings, except for ‘C-z’, to re-enter
     normal state.

2 Settings
**********

Evil’s behaviour can be adjusted by setting some variables.  The list of
all available variables and their current values can be inspected by
doing:

     M-x customize-group RET evil RET

To change the value of a variable, you can use this interface, or add a
‘setq’ form to your Emacs init file, preferably before Evil is loaded.
(1)

     (setq evil-shift-width 0)
     ;; Load Evil
     (require 'evil)

What follows is a non-exhaustive list of the most relevant customization
options.

* Keybindings and other behaviour::
* Search::
* Indentation::

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) (1) Strictly speaking, the order only matters if the variable
affects the way Evil is loaded.  This is the case with some variables.


File: evil.info,  Node: The initial state,  Next: Keybindings and other behaviour,  Up: Settings

2.1 The initial state
=====================

The initial state of a buffer is determined by its major mode.  Evil
maintains an association between major modes and their corresponding
states, which is most easily modified using the function *note
evil-set-initial-state: 30.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-set-initial-state MODE STATE)

     Set the initial state for major mode `MODE' to `STATE'. This is the
     state the buffer comes up in.

If no state can be found, Evil uses the default initial state.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-default-state

     The default Evil state.  This is the state a buffer starts in when
     it is not otherwise configured (see *note evil-set-initial-state:
     30. and *note evil-buffer-regexps: 5.).  The value may be one of
     ‘normal’, ‘insert’, ‘visual’, ‘replace’, ‘operator’, ‘motion’ and
     ‘emacs’.

     Default: ‘normal’

Alternatively, it is possible to select the initial state based on the
buffer `name' rather than its major mode.  This is checked first, so it
takes precedence over the other methods for setting the state.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-buffer-regexps

     Regular expressions determining the initial state for a buffer.
     Entries have the form ‘(REGEXP . STATE)’, where `REGEXP' is a
     regular expression matching the buffer’s name and `STATE' is one of
     ‘normal’, ‘insert’, ‘visual’, ‘replace’, ‘operator’, ‘motion’,
     ‘emacs’ and ‘nil’.  If `STATE' is ‘nil’, Evil is disabled in the
     buffer.

     Default: ‘(("^ \\*load\\*"))’


File: evil.info,  Node: Keybindings and other behaviour,  Next: Search,  Prev: The initial state,  Up: Settings

2.2 Keybindings and other behaviour
===================================

Evil comes with a rich system for modifying its key bindings *note
Keymaps: 4f.  For the most common tweaks, the following variables are
available.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-toggle-key

     The key used to change to and from Emacs state.  Must be readable
     by ‘read-kbd-macro’.  For example: “C-z”.

     Default: ‘"C-z"’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-want-C-i-jump

     Whether ‘C-i’ jumps forward in the jump list (like Vim).
     Otherwise, ‘C-i’ inserts a tab character.

     Default: ‘t’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-want-C-u-delete

     Whether ‘C-u’ deletes back to indentation in insert state.
     Otherwise, ‘C-u’ applies a prefix argument.  The binding of ‘C-u’
     mirrors Emacs behaviour by default due to the relative ubiquity of
     prefix arguments.

     Default: ‘nil’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-want-C-u-scroll

     Whether ‘C-u’ scrolls up (like Vim).  Otherwise, ‘C-u’ applies a
     prefix argument.  The binding of ‘C-u’ mirrors Emacs behaviour by
     default due to the relative ubiquity of prefix arguments.

     Default: ‘nil’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-want-C-d-scroll

     Whether ‘C-d’ scrolls down (like Vim).

     Default: ‘t’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-want-C-w-delete

     Whether ‘C-w’ deletes a word in Insert state.

     Default: ‘t’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-want-C-w-in-emacs-state

     Whether ‘C-w’ prefixes windows commands in Emacs state.

     Default: ‘nil’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-want-Y-yank-to-eol

     Whether ‘Y’ yanks to the end of the line.  The default behavior is
     to yank the whole line, like Vim.

     Default: ‘nil’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-disable-insert-state-bindings

     Whether insert state bindings should be used.  Bindings for escape,
     delete and *note evil-toggle-key: 37. are always available.  If
     this is non-nil, default Emacs bindings are by and large accessible
     in insert state.

     Default: ‘nil’


File: evil.info,  Node: Search,  Next: Indentation,  Prev: Keybindings and other behaviour,  Up: Settings

2.3 Search
==========

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-search-module

     The search module to be used.  May be either ‘isearch’, for Emacs’
     isearch module, or ‘evil-search’, for Evil’s own interactive search
     module.  N.b.  changing this will not affect keybindings.  To swap
     out relevant keybindings, see ‘evil-select-search-module’ function.

     Default: ‘isearch’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-regexp-search

     Whether to use regular expressions for searching in ‘/’ and ‘?’.

     Default: ‘t’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-search-wrap

     Whether search with ‘/’ and ‘?’ wraps around the buffer.  If this
     is non-nil, search stops at the buffer boundaries.

     Default: ‘t’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-flash-delay

     Time in seconds to flash search matches after ‘n’ and ‘N’.

     Default: ‘2’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-ex-hl-update-delay

     Time in seconds of idle before updating search highlighting.
     Setting this to a period shorter than that of keyboard’s repeat
     rate allows highlights to update while scrolling.

     Default: ‘0.02’


File: evil.info,  Node: Indentation,  Next: Cursor movement,  Prev: Search,  Up: Settings

2.4 Indentation
===============

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-auto-indent

     Whether to auto-indent when opening lines with ‘o’ and ‘O’.

     Default: ‘t’, buffer-local

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-shift-width

     The number of columns by which a line is shifted.  This applies to
     the shifting operators ‘>’ and ‘<’.

     Default: ‘4’, buffer-local

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-shift-round

     Whether shifting rounds to the nearest multiple.  If non-nil, ‘>’
     and ‘<’ adjust line indentation to the nearest multiple of *note
     evil-shift-width: 33.

     Default: ‘t’, buffer-local

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-indent-convert-tabs

     If non-nil, the ‘=’ operator converts between leading tabs and
     spaces.  Whether tabs are converted to spaces or vice versa depends
     on the value of ‘indent-tabs-mode’.

     Default: ‘t’


File: evil.info,  Node: Cursor movement,  Next: Cursor display,  Prev: Indentation,  Up: Settings

2.5 Cursor movement
===================

In standard Emacs terms, the cursor is generally understood to be
located between two characters.  In Vim, and therefore also Evil, this
is the case in insert state, but in other states the cursor is
understood to be `on' a character, and that this character is not a
newline.

Forcing this behaviour in Emacs is the source of some potentially
surprising results (especially for traditional Emacs users—users used to
Vim may find the default behavior to their satisfaction).  Many of them
can be tweaked using the following variables.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-repeat-move-cursor

     Whether repeating commands with ‘.’ may move the cursor.  If nil,
     the original cursor position is preserved, even if the command
     normally would have moved the cursor.

     Default: ‘t’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-move-cursor-back

     Whether the cursor is moved backwards when exiting insert state.
     If non-nil, the cursor moves “backwards” when exiting insert state,
     so that it ends up on the character to the left.  Otherwise it
     remains in place, on the character to the right.

     Default: ‘t’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-move-beyond-eol

     Whether the cursor can move past the end of the line.  If non-nil,
     the cursor is allowed to move one character past the end of the
     line, as in Emacs.

     Default: ‘nil’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-cross-lines

     Whether horizontal motions may move to other lines.  If non-nil,
     certain motions that conventionally operate in a single line may
     move the cursor to other lines.  Otherwise, they are restricted to
     the current line.  This applies to ‘h’, ‘SPC’, ‘f’, ‘F’, ‘t’, ‘T’,
     ‘~’.

     Default: ‘nil’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-respect-visual-line-mode

     Whether movement commands respect ‘visual-line-mode’.  If non-nil,
     ‘visual-line-mode’ is generally respected when it is on.  In this
     case, motions such as ‘j’ and ‘k’ navigate by visual lines (on the
     screen) rather than “physical” lines (defined by newline
     characters).  If nil, the setting of ‘visual-line-mode’ is ignored.

     This variable must be set before Evil is loaded.

     Default: ‘nil’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-track-eol

     Whether ‘$’ “sticks” the cursor to the end of the line.  If
     non-nil, vertical motions after ‘$’ maintain the cursor at the end
     of the line, even if the target line is longer.  This is analogous
     to ‘track-eol’, but respects Evil’s interpretation of end-of-line.

     Default: ‘t’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-start-of-line

     Analogue of vim’s ‘startofline’.  If nil, preserve column when
     making relevant movements of the cursor.  Otherwise, move the
     cursor to the start of the line.

     Default: ‘nil’


File: evil.info,  Node: Cursor display,  Next: Window management,  Prev: Cursor movement,  Up: Settings

2.6 Cursor display
==================

A state may change the appearance of the cursor.  Use the variable *note
evil-default-cursor: c. to set the default cursor, and the variables
‘evil-normal-state-cursor’, ‘evil-insert-state-cursor’ etc.  to set the
cursors for specific states.  The acceptable values for all of them are
the same.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-default-cursor

     The default cursor.  May be a cursor type as per ‘cursor-type’, a
     color string as passed to ‘set-cursor-color’, a zero-argument
     function for changing the cursor, or a list of the above.

     Default: ‘t’


File: evil.info,  Node: Window management,  Next: Parenthesis highlighting,  Prev: Cursor display,  Up: Settings

2.7 Window management
=====================

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-auto-balance-windows

     If non-nil window creation and deletion trigger rebalancing.

     Default: ‘t’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-split-window-below

     If non-nil split windows are created below.

     Default: ‘nil’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-vsplit-window-right

     If non-nil vertically split windows with are created to the right.

     Default: ‘nil’


File: evil.info,  Node: Parenthesis highlighting,  Next: Miscellaneous,  Prev: Window management,  Up: Settings

2.8 Parenthesis highlighting
============================

These settings concern the integration between Evil and
‘show-paren-mode’.  They take no effect if this mode is not enabled.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-show-paren-range

     The minimal distance between point and a parenthesis which causes
     the parenthesis to be highlighted.

     Default: ‘0’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable:
          evil-highlight-closing-paren-at-point-states

     The states in which the closing parenthesis at point should be
     highlighted.  All states listed here highlight the closing
     parenthesis at point (which is Vim’s default behavior).  All others
     highlight the parenthesis before point (which is Emacs default
     behavior).  If this list contains the symbol ‘not’ then its meaning
     is inverted, i.e.  all states listed here highlight the closing
     parenthesis before point.

     Default: ‘(not emacs insert replace)’


File: evil.info,  Node: Miscellaneous,  Prev: Parenthesis highlighting,  Up: Settings

2.9 Miscellaneous
=================

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-want-fine-undo

     Whether actions are undone in several steps.  There are two
     possible choices: nil (“no”) means that all changes made during
     insert state, including a possible delete after a change operation,
     are collected in a single undo step.  Non-nil (“yes”) means that
     undo steps are determined according to Emacs heuristics, and no
     attempt is made to aggregate changes.

     For backward compatibility purposes, the value ‘fine’ is
     interpreted as ‘nil’.  This option was removed because it did not
     work consistently.

     Default: ‘nil’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-undo-system

     Undo system Evil should use.  If equal to ‘undo-tree’ or ‘undo-fu’,
     those packages must be installed.  If equal to ‘undo-tree’,
     ‘undo-tree-mode’ must also be activated.  If equal to ‘undo-redo’,
     Evil uses commands natively available in Emacs 28.

     Default: ‘nil’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-backspace-join-lines

     Whether backward delete in insert state may join lines.

     Default: ‘t’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-kbd-macro-suppress-motion-error

     Whether left/right motions signal errors in keyboard macros.  This
     variable only affects beginning-of-line or end-of-line errors
     regarding the motions ‘h’ and ‘SPC’ respectively.  This may be
     desired since such errors cause macro definition or execution to be
     terminated.  There are four possibilities:

        - ‘record’: errors are suppressed when recording macros, but not
          when replaying them.

        - ‘replay’: errors are suppressed when replaying macros, but not
          when recording them.

        - ‘t’: errors are suppressed in both cases.

        - ‘nil’: errors are never suppressed.

     Default: ‘nil’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-mode-line-format

     The position of the state tag in the mode line.  If set to ‘before’
     or ‘after’, the tag is placed at the beginning or the end of the
     mode-line, respectively.  If nil, there is no tag.  Otherwise it
     should be a cons cell ‘(WHERE . WHICH)’, where `WHERE' is either
     ‘before’ or ‘after’, and `WHICH' is a symbol in ‘mode-line-format’.
     The tag is then placed before or after that symbol, respectively.

     Default: ‘before’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-mouse-word

     The `thing-at-point' symbol for double click selection.  The
     double-click starts visual state in a special word selection mode.
     This symbol is used to determine the words to be selected.
     Possible values are ‘evil-word’ or ‘evil-WORD’.

     Default: ‘evil-word’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-bigword

     The set of characters to be interpreted as WORD boundaries.  This
     is enclosed with square brackets and used as a regular expression.
     By default, whitespace characters are considered WORD boundaries.

     Default: ‘"^ \t\r\n"’, buffer-local

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-esc-delay

     The time, in seconds, to wait for another key after escape.  If no
     further event arrives during this time, the event is translated to
     ‘ESC’.  Otherwise, it is translated according to
     ‘input-decode-map’.  This does not apply in Emacs state, and may
     also be inhibited by setting ‘evil-inhibit-esc’.

     Default: ‘0.01’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-intercept-esc

     Whether Evil should intercept the escape key.  In the terminal,
     escape and a meta key sequence both generate the same event.  In
     order to distingush these, Evil uses ‘input-decode-map’.  It is not
     necessary to do this in a graphical Emacs session.  However, if you
     prefer to use ‘C-[’ as escape (which is identical to the terminal
     escape key code), this interception must also happen in graphical
     Emacs sessions.  Set this variable to ‘always’, t (only in the
     terminal) or nil (never intercept).

     Default: ‘always’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-kill-on-visual-paste

     Whether pasting in visual state adds the replaced text to the kill
     ring, making it the default for the next paste.  The default,
     replicates the default Vim behavior.

     Default: ‘t’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-echo-state

     Whether to signal the current state in the echo area.

     Default: ‘t’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-complete-all-buffers

     Whether completion looks for matches in all buffers.  This applies
     to ‘C-n’ and ‘C-p’ in insert state.

     Default: ‘t’

 -- Emacs Lisp Autovariable: evil-want-empty-ex-last-command

     Whether to default to evil-ex-previous-command at empty ex prompt.

     Default: ‘t’


File: evil.info,  Node: Keymaps,  Next: Hooks,  Prev: Settings,  Up: Top

3 Keymaps
*********

Evil’s key bindings are stored in a number of different keymaps.  Each
state has a `global keymap', where the default bindings for that state
are stored.  They are named ‘evil-normal-state-map’,
‘evil-insert-state-map’, and so on.  The bindings in these maps are
visible in all buffers currently in the corresponding state.

These keymaps function like ordinary Emacs keymaps and may be modified
using the Emacs function ‘define-key’:

     (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "w") 'some-function)

This binds the key ‘w’ to the command ‘some-function’ in normal state.
The use of ‘kbd’ is optional for simple key sequences, like this one,
but recommended in general.

Most of Evil’s bindings are defined in the file ‘evil-maps.el’.

To facilitate shared keybindings between states, some states may
activate keybindings from other states as well.  For example, motion
state bindings are visible in normal and visual state, and normal state
bindings are also visible in visual state.

Each state also has a `buffer-local keymap' which is specific to the
current buffer, and which takes precedence over the global keymap.
These maps are most suitably modified by a mode hook.  They are named
‘evil-normal-state-local-map’, ‘evil-insert-state-local-map’, and so on.

     (add-hook 'some-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (define-key evil-normal-state-local-map
                             (kbd "w") 'some-function)))

For convenience, the functions *note evil-global-set-key: 1c. and *note
evil-local-set-key: 22. are available for setting global and local state
keys.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-global-set-key STATE KEY DEF)

     Bind `KEY' to `DEF' in `STATE'.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-local-set-key STATE KEY DEF)

     Bind `KEY' to `DEF' in `STATE' in the current buffer.

The above examples could therefore have been written as follows:

     (evil-global-set-key 'normal (kbd "w") 'some-function)

     (add-hook 'some-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (evil-local-set-key 'normal (kbd "w") 'some-function)))

3.1 evil-define-key
===================

Evil provides the macro *note evil-define-key: f. for adding state
bindings to ordinary keymaps.  It is quite powerful, and is the
preferred method for fine-tuning bindings to activate in specific
circumstances.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-define-key STATE KEYMAP KEY DEF
          [BINDINGS...])

     Create a `STATE' binding from `KEY' to `DEF' for `KEYMAP'. `STATE'
     is one of ‘normal’, ‘insert’, ‘visual’, ‘replace’, ‘operator’,
     ‘motion’, ‘emacs’, or a list of one or more of these.  Omitting a
     state by using ‘nil’ corresponds to a standard Emacs binding using
     ‘define-key’.  The remaining arguments are like those of
     ‘define-key’.  For example:

          (evil-define-key 'normal foo-map "a" 'bar)

     This creates a binding from ‘a’ to ‘bar’ in normal state, which is
     active whenever ‘foo-map’ is active.  Using nil for the state, the
     following lead to identical bindings:

          (evil-define-key nil foo-map "a" 'bar)
          (define-key foo-map "a" 'bar)

     It is possible to specify multiple states and/or bindings at once:

          (evil-define-key '(normal visual) foo-map
            "a" 'bar
            "b" 'foo)

     If ‘foo-map’ has not been initialized yet, this macro adds an entry
     to ‘after-load-functions’, delaying execution as necessary.

     `KEYMAP' may also be a quoted symbol.  If the symbol is ‘global’,
     the global evil keymap corresponding to the state(s) is used,
     meaning the following lead to identical bindings:

          (evil-define-key 'normal 'global "a" 'bar)
          (evil-global-set-key 'normal "a" 'bar)

     The symbol ‘local’ may also be used, which corresponds to using
     *note evil-local-set-key: 22.  If a quoted symbol is used that is
     not ‘global’ or ‘local’, it is assumed to be the name of a minor
     mode, in which case ‘evil-define-minor-mode-key’ is used.

There follows a brief overview of the main functions of this macro.

   - Define a binding in a given state

          (evil-define-key 'state 'global (kbd "key") 'target)

   - Define a binding in a given state in the current buffer

          (evil-define-key 'state 'local (kbd "key") 'target)

   - Define a binding in a given state under the `foo-mode' major mode.

          (evil-define-key 'state foo-mode-map (kbd "key") 'target)

     Note that ‘foo-mode-map’ is unquoted, and that this form is safe
     before ‘foo-mode-map’ is loaded.

   - Define a binding in a given state under the `bar-mode' minor mode.

          (evil-define-key 'state 'bar-mode (kbd "key") 'target)

     Note that ‘bar-mode’ is quoted, and that this form is safe before
     ‘bar-mode’ is loaded.

The macro *note evil-define-key: f. can be used to augment existing
modes with state bindings, as well as creating packages with custom
bindings.  For example, the following will create a minor mode
‘foo-mode’ with normal state bindings for the keys ‘w’ and ‘e’:

     (define-minor-mode foo-mode
       "Foo mode."
       :keymap (make-sparse-keymap))

     (evil-define-key 'normal 'foo-mode "w" 'bar)
     (evil-define-key 'normal 'foo-mode "e" 'baz)

This minor mode can then be enabled in any buffers where the custom
bindings are desired:

     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'foo-mode)  ; enable alongside text-mode

3.2 Leader keys
===============

Evil supports a simple implementation of Vim’s `leader' keys.  To bind a
function to a leader key you can use the expression ‘<leader>’ in a key
mapping, e.g.

     (evil-define-key 'normal 'global (kbd "<leader>fs") 'save-buffer)

Likewise, you can use the expression ‘<localleader>’ to mimic Vim’s
local leader, which is designed for mode-specific key bindings.

You can use the function *note evil-set-leader: 31. to designate which
key acts as the leader and the local leader.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-set-leader STATE KEY [LOCALLEADER])

     Set `KEY' to trigger leader bindings in `STATE'. `KEY' should be in
     the form produced by ‘kbd’.  `STATE' is one of ‘normal’, ‘insert’,
     ‘visual’, ‘replace’, ‘operator’, ‘motion’, ‘emacs’, a list of one
     or more of these, or ‘nil’, which means all of the above.  If
     `LOCALLEADER' is non-nil, set the local leader instead.

4 Hooks
*******

A `hook' is a list of functions that are executed when certain events
happen.  Hooks are modified with the Emacs function ‘add-hook’.  Evil
provides entry and exit hooks for all its states.  For example, when
switching from normal state to insert state, all functions in
‘evil-normal-state-exit-hook’ and ‘evil-insert-state-entry-hook’ are
executed.

It is guaranteed that the exit hook will be executed before the entry
hook on all state switches.

During the hook execution, the variables ‘evil-next-state’ and
‘evil-previous-state’ contain information about the states being
switched to and from, respectively.

***********

The main functionality of Evil is implemented in terms of reusable
macros.  Package writers can use these to define new commands.

* Menu:

* Motions::
* Operators::
* Text objects::
* Range types::
* States::


File: evil.info,  Node: Motions,  Next: Operators,  Up: Extension

5.1 Motions
===========

A `motion' is a command which moves the cursor, such as ‘w’ or ‘e’.
Motions are defined with the macro *note evil-define-motion: 10.
Motions not defined in this way should be declared with *note
evil-declare-motion: 9.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-declare-motion COMMAND)

     Declare `COMMAND' to be a movement function.  This ensures that it
     behaves correctly in visual state.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-define-motion MOTION (COUNT ARGS...)
          DOC [[KEY VALUE]...] BODY...)

     Define a motion command `MOTION'. `ARGS' is a list of arguments.
     Motions can have any number of arguments, but the first (if any)
     has the predefined meaning of count.  `BODY' must execute the
     motion by moving point.

     Optional keyword arguments are:

        - ‘:type’ - determines how the motion works after an operator
          (one of ‘inclusive’, ‘line’, ‘block’ and ‘exclusive’, or a
          self-defined motion type)

        - ‘:jump’ - if non-nil, the previous position is stored in the
          jump list, so that it can be restored with ‘C-o’

For example, this is a motion that moves the cursor forward by a number
of characters:

     (evil-define-motion foo-forward (count)
       "Move to the right by COUNT characters."
       :type inclusive
       (forward-char (or count 1)))

The `type' of a motion determines how it works when used together with
an operator.  Inclusive motions include the endpoint in the range being
operated on, while exclusive motions do not.  Line motions extend the
whole range to linewise positions, effectively behaving as if the
endpoint were really at the end of the line.  Blockwise ranges behave as
a “rectangle” on screen rather than a contiguous range of characters.


File: evil.info,  Node: Operators,  Next: Text objects,  Prev: Motions,  Up: Extension

5.2 Operators
=============

An operator is a command that acts on the text moved over by a motion,
such as ‘c’ (change), ‘d’ (delete) or ‘y’ (yank or copy, not to be
confused with “yank” in Emacs terminology which means `paste').

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-define-operator OPERATOR (BEG END
          ARGS...) DOC [[KEY VALUE]...] BODY...)

     Define an operator command `OPERATOR'. The operator acts on the
     range of characters `BEG' through `END'. `BODY' must execute the
     operator by potentially manipulating the buffer contents, or
     otherwise causing side effects to happen.

     Optional keyword arguments are:

        - ‘:type’ - force the input range to be of a given type
          (‘inclusive’, ‘line’, ‘block’, and ‘exclusive’, or a
          self-defined motion type).

        - ‘:motion’ - use a predetermined motion instead of waiting for
          one from the keyboard.  This does not affect the behavior in
          visual state, where selection boundaries are always used.

        - ‘:repeat’ - if non-nil (default), then ‘.’ will repeat the
          operator.

        - ‘:move-point’ - if non-nil (default), the cursor will be moved
          to the beginning of the range before the body executes

        - ‘:keep-visual’ - if non-nil, the selection is not disabled
          when the operator is executed in visual state.  By default,
          visual state is exited automatically.

For example, this is an operator that performs ROT13 encryption on the
text under consideration:

     (evil-define-operator evil-rot13 (beg end)
       "ROT13 encrypt text."
       (rot13-region beg end))

Binding this to ‘g?’ (where it is by default) will cause a key sequence
such as ‘g?w’ to encrypt from the current cursor to the end of the word.


File: evil.info,  Node: Text objects,  Next: Range types,  Prev: Operators,  Up: Extension

5.3 Text objects
================

Text objects are like motions in that they define a range over which an
operator may act.  Unlike motions, text objects can set both a beginning
and an endpoint.  In visual state, text objects alter both ends of the
selection.

Text objects are not directly usable in normal state.  Instead, they are
bound in the two keymaps ‘evil-inner-text-ojects-map’ and
‘evil-outer-text-objects-map’, which are available in visual and
operator-pending state under the keys ‘i’ and ‘a’ respectively.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-define-text-object OBJECT (COUNT) DOC
          [[KEY VALUE]...] BODY...)

     Define a text object command `OBJECT'. `BODY' should return a range
     ‘(BEG END)’ to the right of point if `COUNT' is positive, and to
     the left of it if negative.

     Optional keyword arguments:

        - ‘:type’ - determines how the range applies after an operator
          (‘inclusive’, ‘line’, ‘block’, and ‘exclusive’, or a
          self-defined motion type).

        - ‘:extend-selection’ - if non-nil (default), the text object
          always enlarges the current selection.  Otherwise, it replaces
          the current selection.

For eample, this is a text object which selects the next three
characters after the current location:

     (evil-define-text-object foo (count)
       "Select three characters."
       (list (point) (+ 3 (point))))

For convenience, Evil provides several functions returning a list of
positions which can be used for defining text objects.  All of them
follow the convention that a positive `count' selects text after the
current location, while negative `count' selects text before it.

     Note: The `thingatpt' library is used quite extensively in Evil to
     define text objects, and this dependency leaks through in the
     following functions.  A `thing' in this context is any symbol for
     which there is a function called ‘forward-THING’ (1) which moves
     past a number of `things'.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-select-inner-object THING BEG END
          TYPE [COUNT LINE])

     Return an inner text object range of `COUNT' objects.  If `COUNT'
     is positive, return objects following point; if `COUNT' is
     negative, return objects preceding point.  If one is unspecified,
     the other is used with a negative argument.  `THING' is a symbol
     understood by `thing-at-point'.  `BEG', `END' and `TYPE' specify
     the current selection.  If `LINE' is non-nil, the text object
     should be linewise, otherwise it is character wise.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-select-an-object THING BEG END TYPE
          COUNT [LINE])

     Return an outer text object range of `COUNT' objects.  If `COUNT'
     is positive, return objects following point; if `COUNT' is
     negative, return objects preceding point.  If one is unspecified,
     the other is used with a negative argument.  `THING' is a symbol
     understood by `thing-at-point'.  `BEG', `END' and `TYPE' specify
     the current selection.  If `LINE' is non-nil, the text object
     should be linewise, otherwise it is character wise.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-select-paren OPEN CLOSE BEG END TYPE
          COUNT [INCLUSIVE])

     Return a range ‘(BEG END)’ of `COUNT' delimited text objects.
     `OPEN' and `CLOSE' specify the opening and closing delimiter,
     respectively.  `BEG' `END' `TYPE' are the currently selected
     (visual) range.  If `INCLUSIVE' is non-nil, `OPEN' and `CLOSE' are
     included in the range; otherwise they are excluded.

     The types of `OPEN' and `CLOSE' specify which kind of THING is used
     for parsing with ‘evil-select-block’.  If `OPEN' and `CLOSE' are
     characters ‘evil-up-paren’ is used.  Otherwise `OPEN' and `CLOSE'
     must be regular expressions and ‘evil-up-block’ is used.

     If the selection is exclusive, whitespace at the end or at the
     beginning of the selection until the end-of-line or
     beginning-of-line is ignored.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) (1) There are many more ways that a `thing' can be defined, but
the definition of ‘forward-THING’ is perhaps the most straightforward
way to go about it.


File: evil.info,  Node: Range types,  Next: States,  Prev: Text objects,  Up: Extension

5.4 Range types
===============

A `type' is a transformation acting on a pair of buffer positions.  Evil
defines the types ‘inclusive’, ‘line’, ‘block’ and ‘exclusive’, which
are used for motion ranges and visual selection.  New types may be
defined with the macro `evil-define-type'.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-define-type TYPE DOC [[KEY FUNC]...])

     Define type `TYPE'. `DOC' is a general description and shows up in
     all docstrings.

     Optional keyword arguments:

        - ‘:expand’ - expansion function.  This function should accept
          two positions in the current buffer, BEG and END,and return a
          pair of expanded buffer positions.

        - ‘:contract’ - the opposite of ‘:expand’.  Optional.

        - ‘:one-to-one’ - non-nil if expansion is one-to-one.  This
          means that ‘:expand’ followed by ‘:contract’ always return the
          original range.

        - ‘:normalize’ - normalization function.  This function should
          accept two unexpanded positions and adjust them before
          expansion.  May be used to deal with buffer boundaries.

        - ‘:string’ - description function.  Takes two buffer positions
          and returns a human-readable string.  For example “2 lines”

     If further keywords and functions are specified, they are assumed
     to be transformations on buffer positions, like ‘:expand’ and
     ‘:contract’.


File: evil.info,  Node: States,  Prev: Range types,  Up: Extension

5.5 States
==========

States are defined with the macro *note evil-define-state: 12, which
takes care to define the necessary hooks, keymaps and variables, as well
as a toggle function ‘evil-NAME-state’ and a predicate function
‘evil-NAME-state-p’ for checking whether the state is active.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-define-state STATE DOC [[KEY VAL]...]
          BODY...)

     Define an Evil state `STATE'. `DOC' is a general description and
     shows up in all docstrings; the first line of the string should be
     the full name of the state.

     `BODY' is executed each time the state is enabled or disabled.

     Optional keyword arguments:

        - ‘:tag’ - the mode line indicator, e.g.  “<T>”.

        - ‘:message’ - string shown in the echo area when the state is
          activated.

        - ‘:cursor’ - default cursor specification.

        - ‘:enable’ - list of other state keymaps to enable when in this
          state.

        - ‘:entry-hook’ - list of functions to run when entering this
          state.

        - ‘:exit-hook’ - list of functions to run when exiting this
          state.

        - ‘:suppress-keymap’ - if non-nil, effectively disables bindings
          to ‘self-insert-command’ by making ‘evil-suppress-map’ the
          parent of the global state keymap.

     The global keymap of this state will be ‘evil-test-state-map’, the
     local keymap will be ‘evil-test-state-local-map’, and so on.

For example:

     (evil-define-state test
       "Test state."
       :tag " <T> "
       (message (if (evil-test-state-p)
                    "Enabling test state."
                  "Disabling test state.")))

6 Frequently Asked Questions
****************************

* Problems with the escape key in the terminal::
* Underscore is not a word character::


File: evil.info,  Node: Problems with the escape key in the terminal,  Next: Underscore is not a word character,  Up: Frequently Asked Questions

6.1 Problems with the escape key in the terminal
================================================

A common problem when using Evil in terminal mode is a certain delay
after pressing the escape key.  Even more, when pressing the escape key
followed quickly by another key the command is recognized as ‘M-<key>’
instead of two separate keys: ‘ESC’ followed by ‘<key>’.  In fact, it is
perfectly valid to simulate ‘M-<key>’ by pressing ‘ESC <key>’ quickly
(but see below).

The reason for this is that in terminal mode a key sequence involving
the meta key (or alt key) always generates a so called “escape
sequence”, i.e.  a sequence of two events sent to Emacs, the first being
‘ESC’ and the second the key pressed simultaneously.  The problem is
that pressing the escape key itself also generates the ‘ESC’ event.
Thus, if Emacs (and therefore Evil) receives an ‘ESC’ event there is no
way to tell whether the escape key has been pressed (and no further
event will arrive) or a ‘M-<key>’ combination has been pressed (and the
‘<key>’ event will arrive soon).  In order to distinguish both
situations Evil does the following.  After receiving an ‘ESC’ event Evil
waits for a short time period (specified by the variable *note
evil-esc-delay: 17. which defaults to 0.01 seconds) for another event.
If no other event arrives Evil assumes that the plain escape key has
been pressed, otherwise it assumes a ‘M-<key>’ combination has been
pressed and combines the ‘ESC’ event with the second one.  Because a
‘M-<key>’ sequence usually generates both events in very quick
succession, 0.01 seconds are usually enough and the delay is hardly
noticeable by the user.

If you use a terminal multiplexer like `tmux' or `screen' the situation
may be worse.  These multiplexers have exactly the same problem
recognizing ‘M-<key>’ sequences and often introduce their own delay for
the ‘ESC’ key.  There is no way for Evil to influence this delay.  In
order to reduce it you must reconfigure your terminal multiplexer.

Note that this problem should not arise when using Evil in graphical
mode.  The reason is that in this case the escape key itself generates a
different command, namely ‘escape’ (a symbol) and hence Evil can
distinguish whether the escape key or a ‘M-<key>’ combination has been
pressed.  But this also implies that pressing ‘ESC’ followed by <key>
cannot be used to simulate ‘M-<key>’ in graphical mode!


File: evil.info,  Node: Underscore is not a word character,  Prev: Problems with the escape key in the terminal,  Up: Frequently Asked Questions

6.2 Underscore is not a word character
======================================

An underscore ‘_’ is a word character in Vim.  This means that word
motions like ‘w’ skip over underlines in a sequence of letters as if it
was a letter itself.  In contrast, in Evil the underscore is often a
non-word character like operators, e.g.  ‘+’.

The reason is that Evil uses Emacs’ definition of a word and this
definition does often not include the underscore.  In Emacs word
characters are determined by the syntax-class of the buffer.  The
syntax-class usually depends on the major-mode of this buffer.  This has
the advantage that the definition of a “word” may be adapted to the
particular type of document being edited.  Evil uses Emacs’ definition
and does not simply use Vim’s definition in order to be consistent with
other Emacs functions.  For example, word characters are exactly those
characters that are matched by the regular expression character class
‘[:word:]’.

If you would be satisfied by having the ‘*’ and ‘#’ searches use symbols
instead of words, this can be achieved by setting the
‘evil-symbol-word-search’ variable to ‘t’.

If you want the underscore to be recognised as word character for other
motions, you can modify its entry in the syntax-table:

     (modify-syntax-entry ?_ "w")

This gives the underscore the ‘word’ syntax class.  You can use a
mode-hook to modify the syntax-table in all buffers of some mode, e.g.:

     (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
               (lambda () (modify-syntax-entry ?_ "w")))

This gives the underscore the word syntax-class in all C-like buffers.

Similarly to Emacs’ definition of a word, the definition of a “symbol”
is also dependent on the syntax-class of the buffer, which often
includes the underscore.  The default text objects keymap associates
kbd::‘o’ with the symbol object, making kbd::‘cio’ a good alternative to
Vim’s kbd::‘ciw’, for example.  The following will swap between the word
and symbol objects in the keymap:

     (define-key evil-outer-text-objects-map "w" 'evil-a-symbol)
     (define-key evil-inner-text-objects-map "w" 'evil-inner-symbol)
     (define-key evil-outer-text-objects-map "o" 'evil-a-word)
     (define-key evil-inner-text-objects-map "o" 'evil-inner-word)

This will not change the motion keys, however.  One way to make word
motions operate as symbol motions is to alias the ‘evil-word’ `thing'
(1) to the ‘evil-symbol’ thing:

     (defalias 'forward-evil-word 'forward-evil-symbol)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) (1) Many of Evil’s text objects and motions are defined in terms
of the `thingatpt' library, which in this case are defined entirely in
terms of ‘forward-THING’ functions.  Thus aliasing one to another should
make all motions and text objects implemented in terms of that `thing'
behave the same.

File: evil.info,  Node: Command properties,  Up: Internals

7.1 Command properties
======================

Evil defines `command properties' to store information about commands
(1), such as whether they should be repeated.  A command property is a
‘:keyword’ with an associated value, e.g.  ‘:repeat nil’.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-add-command-properties COMMAND
          [PROPERTIES...])

     Add `PROPERTIES' to `COMMAND'. `PROPERTIES' should be a property
     list.  To replace all properties at once, use *note
     evil-set-command-properties: 2f.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-set-command-properties COMMAND
          [PROPERTIES...])

     Replace all of `COMMAND'’s properties with `PROPERTIES'.
     `PROPERTIES' should be a property list.  This erases all previous
     properties; to only add properties, use
     ‘evil-set-command-property’.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-get-command-properties COMMAND)

     Return all Evil properties of `COMMAND'. See also *note
     evil-get-command-property: 1b.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-get-command-property COMMAND PROPERTY
          [DEFAULT])

     Return the value of Evil `PROPERTY' of `COMMAND'. If the command
     does not have the property, return `DEFAULT'. See also *note
     evil-get-command-properties: 1a.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-define-command COMMAND (ARGS...) DOC
          [[KEY VALUE]...] BODY...)

     Define a command `COMMAND'.

For setting repeat properties, use the following functions:

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-declare-repeat COMMAND)

     Declare `COMMAND' to be repeatable.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-declare-not-repeat COMMAND)

     Declare `COMMAND' to be nonrepeatable.

 -- Emacs Lisp Autofunction: (evil-declare-change-repeat COMMAND)

     Declare `COMMAND' to be repeatable by buffer changes rather than
     keystrokes.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) (1) In this context, a `command' may mean any Evil motion, text
object, operator or indeed other Emacs commands, which have not been
defined through the Evil machinery.

     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     ‘http://www.gnu.org/copyleft’.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
