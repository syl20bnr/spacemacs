;;; Commentary:

;; A repeat begins when leaving Normal state; it ends when re-entering
;; Normal state. The diagram below shows possible routes between
;; Normal state (N), Insert state (I), Visual state (V),
;; Operator-Pending state (O) and Replace state (R). (Emacs state
;; is an exception: nothing is repeated in that state.)

;; The recording of a repeat is started in one of two cases: Either a
;; command is about to be executed (in pre-command-hook) or normal
;; state is exited. The recording is stopped whenever a command has
;; been completed and evil is in normal state afterwards. Therefore,
;; a non-inserting command in normal-state is recorded as a single
;; repeat unit. In contrast, if the command leaves normal state and
;; starts insert-state, all commands that are executed until
;; insert-state is left and normal state is reactivated are recorded
;; together in one repeat unit. In other words, a repeat unit consists
;; of all commands that are executed starting and ending in normal
;; state.
;;
;; Not all commands are recorded. There are several commands that are
;; completely ignored and other commands that even abort the currently
;; active recording, e.g., commands that switch buffer.
;;
;; During recording the repeat information is appended to the variable
;; `evil-repeat-info', which is cleared when the recording
;; starts. This accumulated repeat information is put into the
;; `evil-repeat-ring' when the recording is finished. The dot command,
;; `\[evil-repeat]' (`evil-repeat') replays the most recent entry in
;; the ring, preceeding repeats can be replayed using
;; `\[evil-repeat-pop]' (`evil-repeat-pop').
;;
;; Repeat information can be stored in almost arbitrary form. How the
;; repeat information for each single command is recorded is
;; determined by the :repeat property of the command. This property
;; has the following interpretation:
;;
;; t         record commands by storing the key-sequence that invoked it
;; nil       ignore this command completely
;; ignore    synonym to nil
;; motion    command is recorded by storing the key-sequence but only in
;;           insert state, otherwise it is ignored.
;; abort     stop recording of repeat information immediately
;; change    record commands by storing buffer changes
;; SYMBOL    if SYMBOL is contained as key in `evil-repeat-types' call
;;           the corresponding (function-)value, otherwise call the
;;           function associated with SYMBOL. In both cases the
;;           function should take exactly one argument which is either
;;           `pre', `pre-read-key-sequence' or `post' specifying on
;;           whether the function is called before or after the
;;           execution of the command.
;;
;; Therefore, using a certain SYMBOL one can write specific repeation
;; functions for each command.
;;
;; Each value of ring `evil-repeat-info', i.e., each single repeat
;; information must be one of the following two possibilities:
;; If element is a sequence, it is regarded as a key-sequence to
;; be repeated. Otherwise the element must be a list
;; (FUNCTION PARAMS ...) which will be called using
;; (apply FUNCTION PARAMS) whenever this repeat is being executed.
;;
;; A user supplied repeat function can use the functions
;; `evil-record-repeat' to append further repeat-information of the
;; form described above to `evil-repeat-info'. See the implementation
;; of `evil-repeat-keystrokes' and `evil-repeat-changes' for examples.
;;
;; The repeat information is executed with `evil-execute-repeat-info',
;; which passes key-sequence elements to `execute-kbd-macro' and
;; executes other elements as defined above.  A special version is
;; `evil-execute-repeat-info-with-count'.  This function works as
;; `evil-execute-repeat-info', but replaces the count of the first
;; command. This is done by parsing the key-sequence, ignoring all
;; calls to `digit-prefix-argument' and `negative-argument', and
;; prepending the count as a string to the vector of the remaining
;; key-sequence.
