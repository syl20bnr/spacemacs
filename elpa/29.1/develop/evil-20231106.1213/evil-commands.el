;;; Motions

;; Movement commands, or motions, are defined with the macro
;; `evil-define-motion'. A motion is a command with an optional
;; argument COUNT (interactively accessed by the code "<c>").
;; It may specify the :type command property (e.g., :type line),
;; which determines how it is handled by an operator command.
;; Furthermore, the command must have the command properties
;; :keep-visual t and :repeat motion; these are automatically
;; set by the `evil-define-motion' macro.

;;; Text objects

;; Text objects are defined with `evil-define-text-object'. In Visual
;; state, they modify the current selection; in Operator-Pending
;; state, they return a pair of buffer positions. Outer text objects
;; are bound in the keymap `evil-outer-text-objects-map', and inner
;; text objects are bound in `evil-inner-text-objects-map'.
;;
;; Common text objects like words, WORDS, paragraphs and sentences are
;; defined via a corresponding move-function. This function must have
;; the following properties:
;;
;;   1. Take exactly one argument, the count.
;;   2. When the count is positive, move point forward to the first
;;      character after the end of the next count-th object.
;;   3. When the count is negative, move point backward to the first
;;      character of the count-th previous object.
;;   4. If point is placed on the first character of an object, the
;;      backward motion does NOT count that object.
;;   5. If point is placed on the last character of an object, the
;;      forward motion DOES count that object.
;;   6. The return value is "count left", i.e., in forward direction
;;      count is decreased by one for each successful move and in
;;      backward direction count is increased by one for each
;;      successful move, returning the final value of count.
;;      Therefore, if the complete move is successful, the return
;;      value is 0.
;;
;; A useful macro in this regard is `evil-motion-loop', which quits
;; when point does not move further and returns the count difference.
;; It also provides a "unit value" of 1 or -1 for use in each
;; iteration. For example, a hypothetical "foo-bar" move could be
;; written as such:
;;
;;     (defun foo-bar (count)
;;       (evil-motion-loop (var count)
;;         (forward-foo var) ; `var' is 1 or -1 depending on COUNT
;;         (forward-bar var)))
;;
;; If "forward-foo" and "-bar" didn't accept negative arguments,
;; we could choose their backward equivalents by inspecting `var':
;;
;;     (defun foo-bar (count)
;;       (evil-motion-loop (var count)
;;         (cond
;;          ((< var 0)
;;           (backward-foo 1)
;;           (backward-bar 1))
;;          (t
;;           (forward-foo 1)
;;           (forward-bar 1)))))
;;
;; After a forward motion, point has to be placed on the first
;; character after some object, unless no motion was possible at all.
;; Similarly, after a backward motion, point has to be placed on the
;; first character of some object. This implies that point should
;; NEVER be moved to eob or bob, unless an object ends or begins at
;; eob or bob. (Usually, Emacs motions always move as far as possible.
;; But we want to use the motion-function to identify certain objects
;; in the buffer, and thus exact movement to object boundaries is
;; required.)
