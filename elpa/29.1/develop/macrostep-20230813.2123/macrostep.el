;;; Commentary:

;; `macrostep' is an Emacs minor mode for interactively stepping through
;; the expansion of macros in Emacs Lisp source code.  It lets you see
;; exactly what happens at each step of the expansion process by
;; pretty-printing the expanded forms inline in the source buffer, which is
;; temporarily read-only while macro expansions are visible.  You can
;; expand and collapse macro forms one step at a time, and evaluate or
;; instrument the expansions for debugging with Edebug as normal (but see
;; "Bugs and known limitations", below).  Single-stepping through the
;; expansion is particularly useful for debugging macros that expand into
;; another macro form.  These can be difficult to debug with Emacs'
;; built-in `macroexpand', which continues expansion until the top-level
;; form is no longer a macro call.

;; Both globally-visible macros as defined by `defmacro' and local macros
;; bound by `(cl-)macrolet' or another macro-defining form can be expanded.
;; Within macro expansions, calls to macros and compiler macros are
;; fontified specially: macro forms using `macrostep-macro-face', and
;; functions with compiler macros using `macrostep-compiler-macro-face'.
;; Uninterned symbols (gensyms) are fontified based on which step in the
;; expansion created them, to distinguish them both from normal symbols and
;; from other gensyms with the same print name.

;; As of version 0.9, it is also possible to extend `macrostep' to work
;; with other languages with macro systems in addition to Emacs Lisp.  An
;; extension for Common Lisp (via SLIME) is in the works; contributions for
;; other languages are welcome.  See "Extending macrostep" below for
;; details.


;; 1 Key-bindings and usage
;; ========================

;;   The standard keybindings in `macrostep-mode' are the following:

;;   e, =, RET : expand the macro form following point one step
;;   c, u, DEL : collapse the form following point
;;   q, C-c C-c: collapse all expanded forms and exit macrostep-mode
;;   n, TAB    : jump to the next macro form in the expansion
;;   p, M-TAB  : jump to the previous macro form in the expansion

;;   It's not very useful to enable and disable macrostep-mode directly.
;;   Instead, bind `macrostep-expand' to a key in `emacs-lisp-mode-map',
;;   for example C-c e:

;;   ,----
;;   | (define-key emacs-lisp-mode-map (kbd "C-c e") 'macrostep-expand)
;;   `----

;;   You can then enter macrostep-mode and expand a macro form completely
;;   by typing `C-c e e e ...' as many times as necessary.

;;   Exit macrostep-mode by typing `q' or `C-c C-c', or by successively
;;   typing `c' to collapse all surrounding expansions.


;; 2 Customization options
;; =======================

;;   Type `M-x customize-group RET macrostep RET' to customize options and
;;   faces.

;;   To display macro expansions in a separate window, instead of inline in
;;   the source buffer, customize `macrostep-expand-in-separate-buffer' to
;;   `t'.  The default is `nil'.  Whichever default behavior is selected,
;;   the alternative behavior can be obtained temporarily by giving a
;;   prefix argument to `macrostep-expand'.

;;   To have `macrostep' ignore compiler macros, customize
;;   `macrostep-expand-compiler-macros' to `nil'.  The default is `t'.

;;   Customize the faces `macrostep-macro-face',
;;   `macrostep-compiler-macro-face', and `macrostep-gensym-1' through
;;   `macrostep-gensym-5' to alter the appearance of macro expansions.


;; 3 Locally-bound macros
;; ======================

;;   As of version 0.9, `macrostep' can expand calls to a locally-bound
;;   macro, whether defined by a surrounding `(cl-)macrolet' form, or by
;;   another macro-defining macro.  In other words, it is possible to
;;   expand the inner `local-macro' forms in both the following examples,
;;   whether `local-macro' is defined by an enclosing `cl-macrolet' --

;;   ,----
;;   | (cl-macrolet ((local-macro (&rest args)
;;   |                 `(expansion of ,args)))
;;   |   (local-macro (do-something)))
;;   `----

;;   -- or by a macro which expands into `cl-macrolet', provided that its
;;   definition of macro is evaluated prior to calling `macrostep-expand':

;;   ,----
;;   | (defmacro with-local-macro (&rest body)
;;   |   `(cl-macrolet ((local-macro (&rest args)
;;   |                    `(expansion of ,args)))
;;   |      ,@body))
;;   |
;;   | (with-local-macro
;;   |     (local-macro (do something (else)))
;;   `----

;;   See the `with-js' macro in Emacs's `js.el' for a real example of the
;;   latter kind of macro.

;;   Expansion of locally-bound macros is implemented by instrumenting
;;   Emacs Lisp's macro-expander to capture the environment at point.  A
;;   similar trick is used to detect macro- and compiler-macro calls within
;;   expanded text so that they can be fontified accurately.


;; 4 Expanding sub-forms
;; =====================

;;   By moving point around in the macro expansion using
;;   `macrostep-next-macro' and `macrostep-prev-macro' (bound to the `n'
;;   and `p' keys), it is possible to expand other macro calls within the
;;   expansion before expanding the outermost form.  This can sometimes be
;;   useful, although it does not correspond to the real order of macro
;;   expansion in Emacs Lisp, which proceeds by fully expanding the outer
;;   form to a non-macro form before expanding sub-forms.

;;   The main reason to expand sub-forms out of order is to help with
;;   debugging macros which programmatically expand their arguments in
;;   order to rewrite them.  Expanding the arguments of such a macro lets
;;   you visualise what the macro definition would compute via
;;   `macroexpand-all'.


;; 5 Extending macrostep for other languages
;; =========================================

;;   Since version 0.9, it is possible to extend macrostep to work with
;;   other languages besides Emacs Lisp.  In typical Emacs fashion, this is
;;   implemented by setting buffer-local variables to different function
;;   values.  Six buffer-local variables define the language-specific part
;;   of the implementation:

;;   - `macrostep-sexp-bounds-function'
;;   - `macrostep-sexp-at-point-function'
;;   - `macrostep-environment-at-point-function'
;;   - `macrostep-expand-1-function'
;;   - `macrostep-print-function'
;;   - `macrostep-macro-form-p-function'

;;   Typically, an implementation for another language would set these
;;   variables in a major-mode hook.  See the docstrings of each variable
;;   for details on how each one is called and what it should return.  At a
;;   minimum, another language implementation needs to provide
;;   `macrostep-sexp-at-point-function', `macrostep-expand-1-function', and
;;   `macrostep-print-function'.  Lisp-like languages may be able to reuse
;;   the default `macrostep-sexp-bounds-function' if they provide another
;;   implementation of `macrostep-macro-form-p-function'.  Languages which
;;   do not implement locally-defined macros can set
;;   `macrostep-environment-at-point-function' to `ignore'.

;;   Note that the core `macrostep' machinery only interprets the return
;;   value of `macrostep-sexp-bounds-function', so implementations for
;;   other languages can use any internal representations of code and
;;   environments which is convenient.  Although the terminology is
;;   Lisp-specific, there is no reason that implementations could not be
;;   provided for non-Lisp languages with macro systems, provided there is
;;   some way of identifying macro calls and calling the compiler /
;;   preprocessor to obtain their expansions.


;; 6 Bugs and known limitations
;; ============================

;;   You can evaluate and edebug macro-expanded forms and step through the
;;   macro-expanded version, but the form that `eval-defun' and friends
;;   read from the buffer won't have the uninterned symbols of the real
;;   macro expansion.  This will probably work OK with CL-style gensyms,
;;   but may cause problems with `make-symbol' symbols if they have the
;;   same print name as another symbol in the expansion.  It's possible that
;;   using `print-circle' and `print-gensym' could get around this.

;;   Please send other bug reports and feature requests to the author.
