1 Overview
**********

“Company” is a modular text completion framework for GNU Emacs.

In other words, it is a package for retrieving, manipulating, and
displaying text completion candidates.  It aims to assist developers,
writers, and scientists during code and text writing.

* Menu:

* Terminology::
* Structure::


File: company.info,  Node: Terminology,  Next: Structure,  Up: Overview

1.1 Terminology
===============

“Completion” is an act of intelligibly guessing possible variants of
words based on already typed characters.  To “complete” a word means to
insert a correctly guessed variant into the buffer.

Consequently, the “candidates” are the aforementioned guessed variants
of words.  Each of the candidates has the potential to be chosen for
successful completion.  And each of the candidates contains the
initially typed characters: either only at the beginning (so-called
“prefix matches”), or also inside (“non-prefix matches”) of a candidate
(1).

The package’s name “Company” is based on the combination of the two
words: ‘Complete’ and ‘Anything’.  These words reflect the package’s
commitment to handling completion candidates and its extensible nature
allowing it to cover a wide range of usage scenarios.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) A good starting point to learn about types of matches is to play
with the Emacs’s user option ‘completion-styles’.  For illustrations on
how Company visualizes the matches, *note Frontends::.


File: company.info,  Node: Structure,  Prev: Terminology,  Up: Overview

1.2 Structure
=============

The Company is easily extensible because its significant building blocks
are pluggable modules: backends (*note Backends::) and frontends (*note
Frontends::).

The “backends” are responsible for retrieving completion candidates;
which are then outputted by the “frontends”.  For an easy and quick
initial setup, Company is supplied with the preconfigured sets of the
backends and frontends.  The default behavior of the modules can be
adjusted per particular needs, goals, and preferences.  It is also
typical to utilize backends from a variety of third-party libraries
(https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/wiki/Third-Party-Packages),
developed to be pluggable with Company.

But Company consists not only of the backends and frontends.

A core of the package plays the role of a controller, connecting the
modules, making them work together; and exposing configurations and
commands for a user to operate with.  For more details, *note
Customization:: and *note Commands::.

Also, Company is bundled with an alternative workflow configuration
“company-tng” — defining ‘company-tng-frontend’, ‘company-tng-mode’, and
‘company-tng-map’ — that allows performing completion with just <TAB>.
To enable this configuration, add the following line to the Emacs
initialization file (*note (emacs)Init File::):

     (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'company-tng-mode)

2 Getting Started
*****************

This chapter provides basic instructions for Company setup and usage.

* Menu:

* Installation::
* Initial Setup::
* Usage Basics::
* Commands::


File: company.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: Initial Setup,  Up: Getting Started

2.1 Installation
================

Company package is distributed via commonly used package archives in a
form of both stable and development releases.  To install Company, type
‘M-x package-install <RET> company <RET>’.

For more details on Emacs package archives, *note (emacs)Packages::.


File: company.info,  Node: Initial Setup,  Next: Usage Basics,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Getting Started

2.2 Initial Setup
=================

The package Company provides a minor mode “company-mode”.

To activate the _company-mode_, execute the command ‘M-x company-mode’
that toggles the mode on and off.  When it is switched on, the mode line
(*note (emacs)Mode line::) should indicate its presence with an
indicator ‘company’.

After _company-mode_ had been enabled, the package auto-starts
suggesting completion candidates.  The candidates are retrieved and
shown according to the typed characters and the default (until a user
specifies otherwise) configurations.

To have Company always enabled for the following sessions, add the line
‘(global-company-mode)’ to the Emacs configuration file (*note
(emacs)Init File::).


File: company.info,  Node: Usage Basics,  Next: Commands,  Prev: Initial Setup,  Up: Getting Started

2.3 Usage Basics
================

By default — having _company-mode_ enabled (*note Initial Setup::) — a
tooltip with completion candidates is shown when a user types in a few
characters.

To initiate completion manually, use the command ‘M-x company-complete’.

To select next or previous of the shown completion candidates, use
respectively key bindings ‘C-n’ and ‘C-p’, then do one of the following:

   • Hit <RET> to choose a selected candidate for completion.

   • Hit <TAB> to complete with the “common part”: characters present at
     the beginning of all the candidates.

   • Hit ‘C-g’ to stop activity of Company.


File: company.info,  Node: Commands,  Prev: Usage Basics,  Up: Getting Started

2.4 Commands
============

Under the hood, mentioned in the previous section keys are bound to the
commands of the out-of-the-box Company.

‘C-n’
‘M-n’
     Select the next candidate (‘company-select-next-or-abort’,
     ‘company-select-next’).

‘C-p’
‘M-p’
     Select the previous candidate (‘company-select-previous-or-abort’,
     ‘company-select-previous’).

‘RET’
‘<return>’
     Insert the selected candidate (‘company-complete-selection’).

‘TAB’
‘<tab>’
     Insert the common part of all the candidates
     (‘company-complete-common’).

‘C-g’
‘<ESC ESC ESC>’
     Cancel _company-mode_ activity (‘company-abort’).

‘C-h’
‘<F1>’
     Display a buffer with the documentation for the selected candidate
     (‘company-show-doc-buffer’).  With a prefix argument (‘C-u C-h’,
     ‘C-u <F1>’), this command toggles between temporary showing the
     documentation and keeping the documentation buffer up-to-date
     whenever the selection changes.

‘C-w’
     Display a buffer with the definition of the selected candidate
     (‘company-show-location’).

The full list of the default key bindings is stored in the variables
‘company-active-map’ and ‘company-search-map’ (1).

Moreover, Company is bundled with a number of convenience commands that
do not have default key bindings defined.  The following examples
illustrate how to assign key bindings to such commands.

     (global-set-key (kbd "<tab>") #'company-indent-or-complete-common)

     (with-eval-after-load 'company
       (define-key company-active-map (kbd "M-/") #'company-complete))

     (with-eval-after-load 'company
       (define-key company-active-map
                   (kbd "TAB")
                   #'company-complete-common-or-cycle)
       (define-key company-active-map
                   (kbd "<backtab>")
                   (lambda ()
                     (interactive)
                     (company-complete-common-or-cycle -1))))

In the same manner, an additional key can be assigned to a command or a
command can be unbound from a key.  For instance:

     (with-eval-after-load 'company
       (define-key company-active-map (kbd "M-.") #'company-show-location)
       (define-key company-active-map (kbd "RET") nil))

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For a more user-friendly output of the pre-defined key bindings,
utilize ‘M-x describe-keymap <RET> company-active-map’ or
‘C-h f <RET> company-mode’.

3 Customization
***************

Emacs provides two equally acceptable ways for user preferences
configuration: via customization interface (for more details, *note
(emacs)Easy Customization::) and a configuration file (*note (emacs)Init
File::).  Naturally, Company can be configured by both of these
approaches.

* Menu:

* Customization Interface::
* Configuration File::


File: company.info,  Node: Customization Interface,  Next: Configuration File,  Up: Customization

3.1 Customization Interface
===========================

In order to employ the customization interface, run
‘M-x customize-group <RET> company’.

This interface outputs all the options available for user customization,
so you may find it beneficial to review this list even if you are going
to configure Company with the configuration file.

For instructions on how to change the settings, *note (emacs)Changing a
Variable::.


File: company.info,  Node: Configuration File,  Prev: Customization Interface,  Up: Customization

3.2 Configuration File
======================

Company is a customization-rich package.  This section lists some of the
core settings that influence the overall behavior of the _company-mode_.

 -- User Option: company-minimum-prefix-length
     This is one of the values (together with ‘company-idle-delay’),
     based on which Company auto-stars looking up completion candidates.
     This option configures how many characters have to be typed in by a
     user before candidates start to be collected and displayed.  An
     often choice nowadays is to configure this option to a lower number
     than the default value of ‘3’.

 -- User Option: company-idle-delay
     This is the second of the options that configure Company’s
     auto-start behavior (together with
     ‘company-minimum-prefix-length’).  The value of this option defines
     how fast Company is going to react to the typed input, such that
     setting ‘company-idle-delay’ to ‘0’ makes Company react
     immediately, ‘nil’ disables auto-starting, and a larger value
     postpones completion auto-start for that number of seconds.  For an
     even fancier setup, set this option value to a predicate function,
     as shown in the following example:

          (setq company-idle-delay
                (lambda () (if (company-in-string-or-comment) nil 0.3)))

 -- User Option: company-global-modes
     This option allows to specify in which major modes _company-mode_
     can be enabled by ‘(global-company-mode)’.  *Note Initial Setup::.
     The default value of ‘t’ enables Company in all major modes.
     Setting ‘company-global-modes’ to ‘nil’ equal in action to toggling
     off _global-company-mode_.  Providing a list of major modes results
     in having _company-mode_ enabled in the listed modes only.  For the
     opposite result, provide a list of major modes with ‘not’ being the
     first element of the list, as shown in the following example:

          (setq company-global-modes '(not erc-mode message-mode eshell-mode))

 -- User Option: company-selection-wrap-around
     Enable this option to loop (cycle) the candidates’ selection: after
     selecting the last candidate on the list, a command to select the
     next candidate does so with the first candidate.  By default, this
     option is disabled, which means the selection of the next candidate
     stops on the last item.  The selection of the previous candidate is
     influenced by this option similarly.

 -- User Option: company-require-match
     To allow typing in characters that don’t match the candidates, set
     the value of this option to ‘nil’.  For an opposite behavior (that
     is, to disallow non-matching input), set it to ‘t’.  By default,
     Company is configured to require a matching input only if a user
     manually enables completion or selects a candidate; by having the
     option configured to call the function ‘company-explicit-action-p’.

 -- User Option: company-lighter-base
     This user options allows to configure a string indicator of the
     enabled _company-mode_ in the mode line.  The default value is
     ‘company’.

 -- User Option: company-insertion-on-trigger
     One more pair of the user options may instruct Company to complete
     with the selected candidate by typing one of the
     ‘company-insertion-triggers’.  The user option
     ‘company-insertion-on-trigger’ can be enabled or disabled by
     setting its value to one of: ‘nil’, ‘t’, or a predicate function
     name.  *note Predicate: (eintr)Wrong Type of Argument.

 -- User Option: company-insertion-triggers
     This option has an effect only when ‘company-insertion-on-trigger’
     is enabled.  The value can be one of: a string of characters, a
     list of syntax description characters (*note (elisp)Syntax Class
     Table::), or a predicate function.  By default, this user option is
     set to the list of the syntax characters: ‘(?\ ?\) ?.)’, which
     translates to the whitespaces, close parenthesis, and punctuation.
     It is safe to configure the value to a character that can
     potentially be part of a valid completion; in this case, Company
     does not treat such characters as triggers.

Hooks
-----

Company exposes the following life-cycle hooks:

 -- User Option: company-completion-started-hook

 -- User Option: company-completion-cancelled-hook

 -- User Option: company-completion-finished-hook

 -- User Option: company-after-completion-hook


File: company.info,  Node: Frontends,  Next: Backends,  Prev: Customization,  Up: Top

4 Frontends
***********

Company is packaged with several frontends and provides a predefined set
of enabled frontends.  A list of the enabled frontends can be changed by
configuring the user option ‘company-frontends’.

Each frontend is simply a function that receives a command and acts
accordingly to it: outputs candidates, hides its output, refreshes
displayed data, and so on.

All of the Company frontends can be categorized by the type of the
output into the three groups: “tooltip-”, “preview-”, and “echo-”
frontends.  We overview these groups in the first sections of this
chapter.  The sections that follow are dedicated to the ways the
displayed candidates can be searched, filtered, and quick-accessed.

File: company.info,  Node: Tooltip Frontends,  Next: Preview Frontends,  Up: Frontends

4.1 Tooltip Frontends
=====================

This group of frontends displays completion candidates in an overlayed
tooltip (aka pop-up).  Company provides three _tooltip frontends_,
listed below.

 -- Function: company-pseudo-tooltip-unless-just-one-frontend
     This is one of the default frontends.  It starts displaying a
     tooltip only if more than one completion candidate is available,
     which nicely combines — and it is done so by default — with
     ‘company-preview-if-just-one-frontend’, *note Preview Frontends::.

 -- Function: company-pseudo-tooltip-frontend
     This frontend outputs a tooltip for any number of completion
     candidates.

 -- Function: company-pseudo-tooltip-unless-just-one-frontend-with-delay
     This is a peculiar frontend, that displays a tooltip only if more
     than one candidate is available, and only after a delay.  The delay
     can be configured with the user option
     ‘company-tooltip-idle-delay’.  A typical use case for plugging in
     this frontend would be displaying a tooltip only on a manual
     request (when needed), as shown in the following example:

          (setq company-idle-delay 0
                company-tooltip-idle-delay 10
                company-require-match nil
                company-frontends
                '(company-pseudo-tooltip-unless-just-one-frontend-with-delay
                  company-preview-frontend
                  company-echo-metadata-frontend)
                company-backends '(company-capf))

          (global-set-key (kbd "<tab>")
                          (lambda ()
                            (interactive)
                            (let ((company-tooltip-idle-delay 0.0))
                              (company-complete)
                              (and company-candidates
                                   (company-call-frontends 'post-command)))))

User Options
------------

To change the _tooltip frontends_ configuration, adjust the following
user options.

 -- User Option: company-tooltip-align-annotations
     An “annotation” is a string that carries additional information
     about a candidate; such as a data type, function arguments, or
     whatever a backend appoints to be a valuable piece of information
     about a candidate.  By default, the annotations are shown right
     beside the candidates.  Setting the option value to ‘t’ aligns
     annotations to the right side of the tooltip.

          (setq company-tooltip-align-annotations t)

          [image src="./images/small/tooltip-annotations.png" ]

 -- User Option: company-tooltip-annotation-padding
     Adds left padding to the candidates’ annotations.  It is disabled
     by default.  If ‘company-tooltip-align-annotations’ is enabled,
     ‘company-tooltip-annotation-padding’ defines the minimum spacing
     between a candidate and annotation, with the default value of 1.

          (setq company-tooltip-annotation-padding 1)

 -- User Option: company-tooltip-limit
     Controls the maximum number of the candidates shown simultaneously
     in the tooltip (the default value is ‘10’).  When the number of the
     available candidates is larger than this option’s value, Company
     paginates the results.

          (setq company-tooltip-limit 4)

             [image src="./images/small/tooltip-limit.png" ]

 -- User Option: company-tooltip-offset-display
     Use this option to choose in which way to output paginated results.
     The default value is ‘scrollbar’.  Another supported value is
     ‘lines’; choose it to show the quantity of the candidates not
     displayed by the current tooltip page.

          (setq company-tooltip-offset-display 'lines)

         [image src="./images/small/tooltip-offset-display.png" ]

 -- User Option: company-tooltip-minimum
     This user option acts only when a tooltip is shown close to the
     bottom of a window.  It guarantees visibility of this number of
     completion candidates below point.  When the number of lines
     between point and the bottom of a window is less than
     ‘company-tooltip-minimum’ value, the tooltip is displayed above
     point.

          (setq company-tooltip-minimum 4)

         [image src="./images/small/tooltip-minimum-below.png" ]


         [image src="./images/small/tooltip-minimum-above.png" ]

 -- User Option: company-tooltip-flip-when-above
     This is one of the fancy features Company has to suggest.  When
     this setting is enabled, no matter if a tooltip is shown above or
     below point, the candidates are always listed starting near point.
     (Putting it differently, the candidates are mirrored horizontally
     if a tooltip changes its position, instead of being commonly listed
     top-to-bottom.)

          (setq company-tooltip-flip-when-above t)

              [image src="./images/small/tooltip-flip.png" ]

 -- User Option: company-tooltip-minimum-width
     Sets the minimum width of a tooltip, excluding the margins and the
     scroll bar.  Changing this value especially makes sense if a user
     navigates between tooltip pages.  Keeping this value at the default
     ‘0’ allows Company to always adapt the width of the tooltip to the
     longest shown candidate.  Enlarging ‘company-tooltip-minimum-width’
     prevents possible significant shifts in the width of the tooltip
     when navigating to the next/previous tooltip page.  (For an
     alternate solution, see ‘company-tooltip-width-grow-only’.)

 -- User Option: company-tooltip-width-grow-only
     This is another way to restrict auto-adaptation of the tooltip
     width (another is by adjusting ‘company-tooltip-minimum-width’
     value) when navigating between the tooltip pages.

 -- User Option: company-tooltip-maximum-width
     This user option controls the maximum width of the tooltip inner
     area.  By default, its value is pseudo-limitless, potentially
     permitting the output of extremely long candidates.  But if long
     lines become an issue, set this option to a smaller number, such as
     ‘60’ or ‘70’.

 -- User Option: company-tooltip-margin
     Controls the width of the “margin” on the sides of the tooltip
     inner area.  If ‘company-format-margin-function’ is set,
     ‘company-tooltip-margin’ defines only the right margin.

          (setq company-tooltip-margin 3)

             [image src="./images/small/tooltip-margin.png" ]

Candidates Icons
----------------

An “icon” is an image or a text that represents a candidate’s kind; it
is displayed in front of a candidate.  The term “kind” here stands for a
high-level category a candidate fits into.  (Such as ‘array’,
‘function’, ‘file’, ‘string’, ‘color’, etc.  For an extended list of the
possible _kinds_, see the user option ‘company-text-icons-mapping’ or
the variable ‘company-vscode-icons-mapping’.)

 -- User Option: company-format-margin-function
     Allows setting a function to format the left margin of a tooltip
     inner area; namely, to output candidate’s _icons_.  The predefined
     formatting functions are listed below.  A user may also set this
     option to a custom function.  To disable left margin formatting,
     set the value of the option to ‘nil’ (this way control over the
     size of the left margin returns to the user option
     ‘company-tooltip-margin’).

 -- Function: company-vscode-dark-icons-margin
 -- Function: company-vscode-light-icons-margin
     These functions utilize VSCode dark and light theme icon sets (1).
     The related two user options are ‘company-icon-size’ and
     ‘company-icon-margin’.

          [image src="./images/small/tooltip-icons-vscode.png" ]

 -- Function: company-text-icons-margin
     This function produces letters and symbols formatted according to
     the ‘company-text-icons-format’.  The rest of the user options
     affecting this function behavior are listed below.

           [image src="./images/small/tooltip-icons-text.png" ]

 -- Function: company-dot-icons-margin
     This function produces a colored Unicode symbol of a circle
     formatted according to the ‘company-dot-icons-format’.  Other user
     options that affect the resulting output are listed below.

           [image src="./images/small/tooltip-icons-dot.png" ]

The following user options influence appearance of the _text_ and _dot_
_icons_.

 -- User Option: company-text-icons-mapping
     Lists candidates’ _kinds_ with their corresponding _icons_
     configurations.

 -- User Option: company-text-face-extra-attributes
     A list of face attributes to be applied to the _icons_.

          (setq company-text-face-extra-attributes
                '(:weight bold :slant italic))

           [image src="./images/small/tooltip-icon-face.png" ]

 -- User Option: company-text-icons-add-background
     If this option is enabled, when an _icon_ doesn’t have a background
     configured by ‘company-text-icons-mapping’, then a generated
     background is applied.

          (setq company-text-icons-add-background t)

            [image src="./images/small/tooltip-icon-bg.png" ]

 -- Function: company-detect-icons-margin
     This is the default margin formatting function, that applies one of
     the ‘company-vscode-*-icons-margin’ functions if ‘vscode’ icons set
     is supported; otherwise applies a ‘company-text-icons-margin’
     function.

Faces
-----

Out-of-the-box Company defines and configures distinguished faces (*note
(emacs)Faces::) for light and dark themes.  Moreover, some of the
built-in and third-party themes fine-tune Company to fit their palettes.
That is why there’s often no real need to make such adjustments on a
user side.  However, this chapter presents some hints on where to start
customizing Company interface.

Namely, the look of a tooltip is controlled by the ‘company-tooltip*’
named faces.

The following example hints how a user may approach tooltip faces
customization:

     (custom-set-faces

4.2 Preview Frontends
=====================

Frontends in this group output a completion candidate or a common part
of the candidates temporarily inline, as if a word had already been
completed (1).

 -- Function: company-preview-if-just-one-frontend
     This is one of the frontends enabled by default.  This frontend
     outputs a preview if only one completion candidate is available; it
     is a good suit to be combined with
     ‘company-pseudo-tooltip-unless-just-one-frontend’, *note Tooltip
     Frontends::.

 -- Function: company-preview-frontend
     This frontend outputs the first of the available completion
     candidates inline for a preview.

 -- Function: company-preview-common-frontend
     As the name of this frontend suggests, it outputs for a preview
     only a common part of the candidates.

The look of the preview is controlled by the following faces:
‘company-preview’, ‘company-preview-common’, and
‘company-preview-search’.

4.3 Echo Frontends
==================

The frontends listed in this section display information in the Emacs’s
echo area, *note (emacs)Echo Area::.

 -- Function: company-echo-metadata-frontend
     This frontend is a part of the predefined frontends set.  Its
     responsibility is to output a short documentation string for a
     completion candidate in the echo area.

               [image src="./images/small/echo-meta.png" ]


The last pair of the built-in frontends isn’t that commonly used and not
as full-featured as the previously reviewed _tooltip-_ and _preview-_
frontends, but still, feel free to play with them and have some fun!

 -- Function: company-echo-frontend
     This frontend outputs all the available completion candidates in
     the echo area.

                  [image src="./images/small/echo.png" ]

 -- Function: company-echo-strip-common-frontend
     It acts similarly to the previous frontend but outputs a common
     part of the candidates once for all of them.

               [image src="./images/small/echo-strip.png" ]

 -- User Option: company-echo-truncate-lines
     This is the only _echo frontends_ targeted setting.  When enabled,
     the output is truncated to fit the echo area.  This setting is set
     to ‘t’ by default.

To apply visual changes to the output of these frontends, configure the
faces ‘company-echo’ and ‘company-echo-common’.


File: company.info,  Node: Candidates Search,  Next: Filter Candidates,  Prev: Echo Frontends,  Up: Frontends

4.4 Candidates Search
=====================

By default, when _company-mode_ is in action, a key binding ‘C-s’ starts
looking for matches to additionally typed characters among the displayed
candidates.  When a search is initiated, an indicator
‘Search: CHARACTERS’ is shown in the Emacs’s mode line.

To quit the search mode, hit ‘C-g’.

 -- User Option: company-search-regexp-function
     The value of this user option must be a function that interprets
     the search input.  By default it is set to the function
     ‘regexp-quote’, with looks for an exact match.  Company defines
     several more functions suitable for this option.  They are listed
     below.

 -- Function: company-search-words-regexp
     Searches for words separated with spaces in the given order.

 -- Function: company-search-words-in-any-order-regexp
     Searches for words separated with spaces in any order.

 -- Function: company-search-flex-regexp
     Searches for characters in the given order, with anything in
     between.

Search matches are distinguished by the ‘company-tooltip-search’ and
‘company-tooltip-search-selection’ faces.

File: company.info,  Node: Filter Candidates,  Next: Quick Access a Candidate,  Prev: Candidates Search,  Up: Frontends

4.5 Filter Candidates
=====================

Candidates filtering is started by typing the default key binding
‘C-M-s’.  Filtering acts on a par with the search (*note Candidates
Search::), indicating its activation by the text ‘Filter: CHARACTERS’ in
the mode line and influencing the displayed candidates.  The difference
is that the filtering, as its name suggests, keeps displaying only the
matching candidates (in addition to distinguishing the matches with a
face).

To quit the filtering, hit ‘C-g’.  To toggle between search and filter
states, use key binding ‘C-o’.

             [image src="./images/small/tooltip-filter.png" ]


File: company.info,  Node: Quick Access a Candidate,  Prev: Filter Candidates,  Up: Frontends

4.6 Quick Access a Candidate
============================

Company provides a way to choose a candidate for completion without
having to navigate to that candidate: by hitting one of the quick-access
keys.  By default, quick-access key bindings utilize a modifier <META>
and one of the digits, such that pressing ‘M-1’ completes with the first
candidate on the list and ‘M-0’ with the tenth candidate.

If ‘company-show-quick-access’ is enabled, _tooltip-_ and _echo-_
frontends show quick-access hints.

     (setq company-show-quick-access 'left)

          [image src="./images/small/tooltip-quick-access.png" ]


                [image src="./images/small/echo-qa.png" ]


             [image src="./images/small/echo-strip-qa.png" ]

To customize the key bindings, either do it via Customization Interface
(*note Customization Interface::) or use the following approach:

     (custom-set-variables
      '(company-quick-access-keys '("a" "o" "e" "u" "i"))
      '(company-quick-access-modifier 'super))

A modifier should be one of ‘meta’, ‘super’, ‘hyper’, ‘ control’.

The following example applies a bit of customization and demonstrates
how to change quick-access hints faces.

     (setq company-show-quick-access t)

     (custom-set-faces
      '(company-tooltip-quick-access ((t (:foreground "pink1"))))
      '(company-tooltip-quick-access-selection
        ((t (:foreground "pink1" :slant italic)))))

5 Backends
**********

We can metaphorically say that each backend is like an engine.  (The
reality is even better since backends are just functions.)  Fueling such
an engine with a command causes the production of material for Company
to move further on.  Typically, moving on means outputting that material
to a user via one or several configured frontends, *note Frontends::.

Just like Company provides a preconfigured list of the enabled
frontends, it also defines a list of the backends to rely on by default.
This list is stored in the user option ‘company-backends’.  The
docstring of this variable has been a source of valuable information for
years.  That’s why we’re going to stick to a tradition and suggest
reading the output of ‘C-h v company-backends’ for insightful details
about backends.  Nevertheless, the fundamental concepts are described in
this user manual too.

* Menu:

* Backends Usage Basics::
* Grouped Backends::
* Package Backends::
* Candidates Post-Processing::


File: company.info,  Node: Backends Usage Basics,  Next: Grouped Backends,  Up: Backends

5.1 Backends Usage Basics
=========================

One of the significant concepts to understand about Company is that the
package relies on one backend at a time (1).  The backends are invoked
one by one, in the sequential order of the items on the
‘company-backends’ list.

The name of the currently active backend is shown in the mode line and
in the output of the command ‘M-x company-diag’.

In most cases (mainly to exclude false-positive results), the next
backend is not invoked automatically.  For the purpose of invoking the
next backend, use the command ‘company-other-backend’: either by calling
it with ‘M-x’ or by binding the command to the keys of your choice, such
as:

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-/") #'company-other-backend)

It is also possible to specifically start a backend with the command
‘M-x company-begin-backend’ or by calling a backend by its name, for
instance: ‘M-x company-capf’.  As usual for Emacs, such backends calls
can be assigned to key bindings, for example:

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c y") 'company-yasnippet)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The grouped backends act as one complex backend.  *Note Grouped
Backends::.


File: company.info,  Node: Grouped Backends,  Next: Package Backends,  Prev: Backends Usage Basics,  Up: Backends

5.2 Grouped Backends
====================

In many cases, it can be desirable to receive candidates from several
backends simultaneously.  This can be achieved by configuring “grouped
backends”: a sub-list of backends in the ‘company-backends’ list, that
is handled specifically by Company.

The most important part of this handling is the merge of the completion
candidates from the grouped backends.  (But only from the backends that
return the same _prefix_ value, see ‘C-h v company-backends’ for more
details.)

To keep the candidates organized in accordance with the grouped backends
order, add the keyword ‘:separate’ to the list of the grouped backends.
The following example illustrates this.

     (defun my-text-mode-hook ()
       (setq-local company-backends
                   '((company-dabbrev company-ispell :separate)
                     company-files)))

     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'my-text-mode-hook)

Another keyword ‘:with’ helps to make sure the results from major/minor
mode agnostic backends (such as _company-yasnippet_,
_company-dabbrev-code_) are returned without preventing results from
context-aware backends (such as _company-capf_ or _company-clang_).  For
this feature to work, put backends dependent on a mode at the beginning
of the grouped backends list, then put a keyword ‘:with’, and only then
put context agnostic backend(s), as shown in the following concise
example:

     (setq company-backends '((company-capf :with company-yasnippet)))

5.3 Package Backends
====================

The following sections give a short overview of the commonly used
backends bundled with Company.  Each section is devoted to one of the
roughly outlined groups of the backends.

Some of the backends expose user options for customization; a few of
these options are introduced below.  For those who would like to fetch
the full list of a backend’s user options, we suggest doing one of the
following:

   • Execute command ‘M-x customize-group <RET> <backend-name>’.

   • Open the source file of the backend and run
     ‘M-x occur <RET> ^(defcustom’.

        − Optionally, search for the matches with
          ‘M-x isearch <RET> (defcustom’.

File: company.info,  Node: Code Completion,  Next: Text Completion,  Up: Package Backends

5.3.1 Code Completion
---------------------

 -- Function: company-capf
     In the Emacs’s world, the current tendency is to have the
     completion logic provided by ‘completion-at-point-functions’ (CAPF)
     implementations.  [Among the other things, this is what the popular
     packages that support language server protocol (LSP) also rely on.]

     Since _company-capf_ works as a bridge to the standard CAPF
     facility, it is probably the most often used and recommended
     backend nowadays, including for Emacs Lisp coding.

     Just to illustrate, the following minimal backends setup

          (setq company-backends '((company-capf company-dabbrev-code)))

     might cover a large number of basic use cases, especially so in
     major modes that have CAPF support implemented.

     For more details on CAPF, *note (elisp)Completion in Buffers::.

 -- Function: company-dabbrev-code
     This backend works similarly to the built-in Emacs package
     _dabbrev_, searching for completion candidates inside the contents
     of the open buffer(s).  Internally, its based on the backend
     _company-dabbrev_ (*note Text Completion::).

 -- Function: company-keywords
     This backend provides completions for many of the widely spread
     programming languages _keywords_: words bearing specific meaning in
     a language.

 -- Function: company-clang
     As the name suggests, use this backend to get completions from
     _Clang_ compiler; that is, for the languages in the _C_ language
     family: _C_, _C++_, _Objective-C_.

 -- Function: company-semantic
     This backend relies on a built-in Emacs package that provides
     language-aware editing commands based on source code parsers, *note
     (emacs)Semantic::.  Having enabled _semantic-mode_ makes it to be
     used by the CAPF mechanism (*note (emacs)Symbol Completion::),
     hence a user may consider enabling _company-capf_ backend instead.

 -- Function: company-etags
     This backend works on top of a built-in Emacs package _etags_,
     *note (emacs)Tags Tables::.  Similarly to aforementioned _Semantic_
     usage, tags-based completions now are a part of the Emacs’ CAPF
     facility, therefore a user may consider switching to _company-capf_
     backend.


File: company.info,  Node: Text Completion,  Next: File Name Completion,  Prev: Code Completion,  Up: Package Backends

5.3.2 Text Completion
---------------------

 -- Function: company-dabbrev
     This backend works similarly to the built-in Emacs package
     _dabbrev_, searching for completion candidates inside the contents
     of the open buffer(s).  It is one of the often used backends, and
     it has several interesting options for configuration.  Let’s review
     a few of them.

      -- User Option: company-dabbrev-minimum-length
          This option sets the minimum length of a completion candidate
          to collect from the text.  The default value of ‘4’ is
          intended to prevent potential performance issues.  But in many
          scenarios, it may be acceptable to lower this value.  Note
          that this option also affects the behavior of the
          _company-dabbrev-code_ backend.

               (setq company-dabbrev-minimum-length 2)

      -- User Option: company-dabbrev-other-buffers
          By default, _company-dabbrev_ collects completion candidates
          from all not ignored buffers (see more on that below).  This
          behavior can be changed to collecting candidates from the
          current buffer only (by setting the value to ‘nil’) or from
          the buffers with the same major mode:

               (setq company-dabbrev-other-buffers t)

      -- User Option: company-dabbrev-ignore-buffers
          The value of this option should be a regexp or a predicate
          function that can be used to match a buffer name.  The matched
          buffers are omitted from the search for completion candidates.

     The last two options described here relate to handling uppercase
     and lowercase letters in completion candidates.  The illustrative
     examples given below can be reproduced in the ‘*scratch*’ buffer,
     with the word ‘Enjoy’ typed in, and with this initial setup:

          (setq-local company-backends '(company-dabbrev)
                      company-dabbrev-other-buffers nil
                      company-dabbrev-ignore-case nil
                      company-dabbrev-downcase nil)

      -- User Option: company-dabbrev-ignore-case
          This user option controls whether the case is ignored when
          collecting completion candidates.  When the option is set to
          ‘nil’, ‘Enjoy’ is suggested as a completion candidate for the
          typed ‘Enj’ letters, but not for ‘enj’.  When the option is
          set to ‘t’, ‘Enjoy’ is suggested as a candidate for both ‘Enj’
          and ‘enj’ input; note that ‘enj’ prefix is “overwritten” by
          completing with the ‘Enjoy’ candidate.  The third, default,
          type of behavior solves this issue, keeping the case of the
          typed prefix (and still collecting candidates
          case-insensitively):

               (setq company-dabbrev-ignore-case 'keep-prefix)

          Now we can type ‘enj’, complete it with the suggested ‘Enjoy’,
          and _enjoy_ the result.

      -- User Option: company-dabbrev-downcase
          This user option controls whether completion candidates are
          down-cased before their display.  When the option is set to
          ‘nil’, no transformation is performed; in the environment
          described above, typing ‘Enj’ results in the candidate ‘Enjoy’
          being suggested.  When the option is set to ‘t’, the
          down-cased candidate ‘enjoy’ is suggested.  By default, this
          option is set to ‘case-replace’, meaning taking a value of the
          Emacs’s variable ‘case-replace’ (‘t’ is the current default).


 -- Function: company-ispell
     This backend returns completion candidates collected by _Ispell_, a
     built-in Emacs package that performs spell-checking.  *Note
     Checking and Correcting Spelling: (emacs)Spelling.  Note that
     _Ispell_ uses only one dictionary at a time (combining several
     dictionaries into one file is an accepted practice).  By default,
     _company-ispell_ suggests candidates from a dictionary specified by
     the Emacs’s setting ‘ispell-complete-word-dict’.

      -- User Option: company-ispell-dictionary
          Optionally, set a file path for _company-ispell_ to use
          another dictionary.


File: company.info,  Node: File Name Completion,  Next: Template Expansion,  Prev: Text Completion,  Up: Package Backends

5.3.3 File Name Completion
--------------------------

 -- Function: company-files
     This backend can be used to retrieve completion candidates for the
     absolute and relative paths in the directory structure of an
     operating system.  The behavior of the _company-files_ backend can
     be adjusted with the two user options.

      -- User Option: company-files-exclusions
          It may be desirable to exclude directories or files from the
          list of suggested completion candidates.  For example,
          someone’s setup might look this way:

               (setq company-files-exclusions '(".git/" ".DS_Store"))

      -- User Option: company-files-chop-trailing-slash
          This setting is enabled by default, which results in stripping
          off a trailing slash from an inserted directory name.  On
          typing a trailing slash, the process of completion gets
          started again, from inside the just inserted directory.

          Setting ‘company-files-chop-trailing-slash’ to ‘nil’ makes
          directory names to be inserted as is, with a trailing slash.
          In this case, the completion process can be continued, for
          example, either by explicitly calling _company-files_ backend
          (*note Backends Usage Basics::) or by starting typing a name
          of a file/directory known to be located under the inserted
          directory.


File: company.info,  Node: Template Expansion,  Prev: File Name Completion,  Up: Package Backends

5.3.4 Template Expansion
------------------------

 -- Function: company-abbrev
     This is a completion backend for a built-in word abbreviation mode
     (*note (emacs)Abbrevs::), that allows completing abbreviations with
     their expansions.

 -- Function: company-tempo
     A backend for users of Tempo
     (https://www.lysator.liu.se/~davidk/elisp/), one more built-in
     Emacs package for creating and inserting (expanding) templates.

 -- Function: company-yasnippet
     Used as a completion backend for the popular third-party template
     system YASnippet (https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet).


File: company.info,  Node: Candidates Post-Processing,  Prev: Package Backends,  Up: Backends

5.4 Candidates Post-Processing
==============================

A list of completion candidates, supplied by a backend, can be
additionally manipulated (reorganized, reduced, sorted, etc) before its
output.  This is done by adding a processing function name to the user
option ‘company-transformers’ list, for example:

     (setq company-transformers '(delete-consecutive-dups
                                  company-sort-by-occurrence))

Company is bundled with several such transformer functions.  They are
listed below.

 -- Function: company-sort-by-occurrence
     Sorts candidates using ‘company-occurrence-weight-function’
     algorithm.

 -- User Option: company-occurrence-weight-function
     Can be set to one of ‘company-occurrence-prefer-closest-above’
     (default) or ‘company-occurrence-prefer-any-closest’.  This user
     option defines the behavior of the ‘company-sort-by-occurrence’
     transformer function.

 -- Function: company-sort-by-backend-importance
     Sorts candidates as two priority groups, differentiated by the
     keyword ‘:with’ (*note Grouped Backends::).  Backends positioned in
     the backends list before the keyword ‘:with’ are treated as more
     important.

 -- Function: company-sort-prefer-same-case-prefix
     Gives preference to the candidates that match the prefix
     case-insensitively.

6 Troubleshooting
*****************

If something goes wrong, the first thing we recommend doing is to
execute command ‘M-x company-diag’ and thoroughly study its output.

This command outputs important details about the internal workings of
Company at the moment of the ‘company-diag’ command execution, including
a responsible backend and a list of completion candidates provided by
it.

Based on the value of the ‘Used backend’ in the output of the command
‘M-x company-diag’, these possible actions may follow:

   • If the used backend does not belong to the Company package, report
     the issue to the corresponding third-party package maintainer(s).

   • If the used backend is ‘company-capf’, then take a look at the line
     starting with ‘Value of c-a-p-f:’.  The issue could have been
     caused by a function listed there.  To identify to which package it
     belongs, type ‘M-x find-function <RET> <function-name> <RET>’.

If the aforementioned steps didn’t help to find the cause of the issue,
then file a bug report to
the Company Issue Tracker (https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues),
attaching the following information:

  1. Output of the ‘M-x company-diag’.

  2. The exact error message: you can find it in the ‘*Messages*’
     buffer.

  3. The steps to reproduce the behavior.  Ideally, if you can, starting
     with a bare Emacs session: ‘emacs -Q’.

  4. The backtrace of the error, which you can get by running the
     command: ‘M-x toggle-debug-on-error’ before reproducing the error.
