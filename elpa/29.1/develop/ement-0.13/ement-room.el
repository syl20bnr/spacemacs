;;; Commentary:

;; This library implements buffers displaying events in a room.

;; EWOC is a great library.  If I had known about it and learned it
;; sooner, it would have saved me a lot of time in other projects.
;; I'm glad I decided to try it for this one.

;;; Code:

;;;; Debugging

;; NOTE: Uncomment this form and `emacs-lisp-byte-compile-and-load' the file to enable
;; `ement-debug' messages.  This is commented out by default because, even though the
;; messages are only displayed when `warning-minimum-log-level' is `:debug' at runtime, if
;; that is so at expansion time, the expanded macro calls format the message and check the
;; log level at runtime, which is not zero-cost.
