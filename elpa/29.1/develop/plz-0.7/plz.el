;;; Commentary:
;;
;; An HTTP library that uses curl as a backend.  Inspired by, and some
;; code copied from, Christopher Wellons's library, elfeed-curl.el.
;;
;; Why this package?
;;
;; 1.  `url' works well for many things, but it has some issues.
;; 2.  `request' works well for many things, but it has some issues.
;; 3.  Chris Wellons doesn't have time to factor his excellent
;;     elfeed-curl.el library out of Elfeed.  This will have to do.
;;
;; Why is it called `plz'?
;;
;; 1.  There's already a package called `http'.
;; 2.  There's already a package called `request'.
;; 3.  Naming things is hard.

;;;; Usage:

;; FIXME(v0.8): Remove the following note.

;; NOTE: In v0.8 of plz, only one error will be signaled: `plz-error'.
;; The existing errors, `plz-curl-error' and `plz-http-error', inherit
;; from `plz-error' to allow applications to update their code while
;; using v0.7 (i.e. any `condition-case' forms should now handle only
;; `plz-error', not the other two).

;; Call function `plz' to make an HTTP request.  Its docstring
;; explains its arguments.  `plz' also supports other HTTP methods,
;; uploading and downloading binary files, sending URL parameters and
;; HTTP headers, configurable timeouts, error-handling "else" and
;; always-called "finally" functions, and more.

;; Basic usage is simple.  For example, to make a synchronous request
;; and return the HTTP response body as a string:
;;
;;   (plz 'get "https://httpbin.org/get")
;;
;; Which returns the JSON object as a string:
;;
;;   "{
;;     \"args\": {},
;;     \"headers\": {
;;       \"Accept\": \"*/*\",
;;       \"Accept-Encoding\": \"deflate, gzip\",
;;       \"Host\": \"httpbin.org\",
;;       \"User-Agent\": \"curl/7.35.0\"
;;     },
;;     \"origin\": \"xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\",
;;     \"url\": \"https://httpbin.org/get\"
;;   }"
;;
;; To make the same request asynchronously, decoding the JSON and
;; printing a message with a value from it:
;;
;;   (plz 'get "https://httpbin.org/get" :as #'json-read
;;     :then (lambda (alist) (message "URL: %s" (alist-get 'url alist))))
;;
;; Which, after the request returns, prints:
;;
;;   URL: https://httpbin.org/get

;;;; Functions

;;;;; Public

(cl-defun plz (method url &rest rest &key headers body else finally noquery
                      (as 'string) (then 'sync)
                      (body-type 'text) (decode t decode-s)
                      (connect-timeout plz-connect-timeout) (timeout plz-timeout))
  "Request METHOD from URL with curl.
Return the curl process object or, for a synchronous request, the
selected result.

HEADERS may be an alist of extra headers to send with the
request.

BODY may be a string, a buffer, or a list like `(file FILENAME)'
to upload a file from disk.

BODY-TYPE may be `text' to send BODY as text, or `binary' to send
it as binary.

AS selects the kind of result to pass to the callback function
THEN, or the kind of result to return for synchronous requests.
It may be:

- `buffer' to pass the response buffer, which will be narrowed to
  the response body and decoded according to DECODE.

- `binary' to pass the response body as an un-decoded string.

- `string' to pass the response body as a decoded string.

- `response' to pass a `plz-response' structure.

- `file' to pass a temporary filename to which the response body
  has been saved without decoding.

- `(file FILENAME)' to pass FILENAME after having saved the
  response body to it without decoding.  FILENAME must be a
  non-existent file; if it exists, it will not be overwritten,
  and an error will be signaled.

- A function, which is called in the response buffer with it
  narrowed to the response body (suitable for, e.g. `json-read').

If DECODE is non-nil, the response body is decoded automatically.
For binary content, it should be nil.  When AS is `binary',
DECODE is automatically set to nil.

THEN is a callback function, whose sole argument is selected
above with AS; if the request fails and no ELSE function is
given (see below), the argument will be a `plz-error' structure
describing the error.  Or THEN may be `sync' to make a
synchronous request, in which case the result is returned
directly from this function.

ELSE is an optional callback function called when the request
fails (i.e. if curl fails, or if the HTTP response has a non-2xx
status code).  It is called with one argument, a `plz-error'
structure.  If ELSE is nil, a `plz-curl-error' or
`plz-http-error' is signaled when the request fails, with a
`plz-error' structure as the error data.  For synchronous
requests, this argument is ignored.

NOTE: In v0.8 of `plz', only one error will be signaled:
`plz-error'.  The existing errors, `plz-curl-error' and
`plz-http-error', inherit from `plz-error' to allow applications
to update their code while using v0.7 (i.e. any `condition-case'
forms should now handle only `plz-error', not the other two).

FINALLY is an optional function called without argument after
THEN or ELSE, as appropriate.  For synchronous requests, this
argument is ignored.

CONNECT-TIMEOUT and TIMEOUT are a number of seconds that limit
how long it takes to connect to a host and to receive a response
from a host, respectively.

NOQUERY is passed to `make-process', which see.
